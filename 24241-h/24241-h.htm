<h2>JUDY OF YORK HILL</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>BEGINNINGS</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Yes</span>, we're nearly in," said Uncle Tom,
glancing out at the flying landscape. "There's
the lake, and here comes the porter to stir up
the dust."</p>

<p>Judith's heart beat a little more quickly.
Toronto and York Hill School had been the
centre of her thoughts for months past, and
now she was almost there and a new life ahead
of her!</p>

<p>"I suppose you've read your 'Tom Brown,'
Judy, eh? 'Like young bears with all your
troubles to come,'" quoted Uncle Tom as he
left her a few minutes later with Aunt Nell
who had come to the station to meet them.
"Can't help having trouble, I'm afraid, but
when you're going to be expelled for not having
solved your geometry problem, just drown
your grief in an ice-cream soda in the tuck
shop"&mdash;and he dexterously inserted a crisp
bank-note into Judith's bag.</p>

<p>"Don't mind him, Judy, darling, he's always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
teasing. We'll do our shopping first of all.
I've arranged for a fitting at Madame's for
you."</p>

<p>"Mother and Daddy sent their love," said
Judith a little soberly as they got into the
waiting motor. "Yes, I think Mother seemed
a little better&mdash;and she's just sure that
Florida will make her perfectly well."</p>

<p>Her lips quivered ever so slightly as she remembered
how every hour was taking her
mother farther away from her.</p>

<p>But Aunt Nell, who had promised her sister
to finish Judith's shopping, made haste to introduce
the fascinating question as to whether
taffeta or cr&ecirc;pe would be best for the afternoon
frock, and how many sweater coats would
she need.</p>

<p>They spent a busy and a delightful morning.
Who doesn't like to get a new outfit? And
then, after luncheon at Aunt Nell's club, they
motored out to York, for they had an appointment
with the Head Mistress at three o'clock.</p>

<p>"Just around this curve and then we can see
the School&mdash;there!" said Aunt Nell, and
Judith leaned forward, her eyes shining with
excitement.</p>

<p>"Blessed old York! I can't have quite the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
same affection, of course, for these new buildings
as I had for the old School in town&mdash;York
Ladies' College it was then; but this
certainly is handsomer, and we've still got
Miss Meredith and some of the old staff, so
it's the same York."</p>

<p>Judith looked eagerly at the great pile of
grey stone vine-clad buildings.</p>

<p>"That's the main school with the bell-tower,"
continued Aunt Nell in her character
of guide. "The classrooms and offices are
there, the two wings are East and West
Houses, farther to the north&mdash;there, you see&mdash;is
North House, and here is South where you
are to be. That's Miss Meredith's house over
there by the maple trees, and back of the main
school are the gymnasium and the tennis courts.
I hope you've brought your tennis racquet;
you'll get excellent practice."</p>

<p>Aunt Nell paused for a moment, and then
she laughed a little ruefully.</p>

<p>"I'd love to give you a bit of advice or guidance
that would help, Judy; but honestly I
don't know how to do it. Fathers and uncles
in the school stories always seem to know what
to say. I do know that you're going to have
a splendid time&mdash;I wish <i>I</i> were sixteen again<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
and my first year at York before me." Aunt
Nell looked reminiscent for a moment, and then
added, "One thing&mdash;York is going to help
you to grow; and if I didn't feel rather like a
very heavy uncle who was being listened to for
the tip he was to bestow, I'd conclude by quoting
from 'Hamlet'&mdash;yes, I will&mdash;it's the
soundest piece of advice I know.</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">'To thine own self be true,</span><br />
And it shall follow as the night the day,<br />
Thou canst not then be false to any man.'<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>There, that's my last will and testament.
York is going to show you how to be true to
the best that's in you; perhaps the girls will
teach you as much as the staff will&mdash;you've
got some very important things to learn from
them."</div>

<p>Judith looked politely astonished, but not
very deeply interested. Fancy having to listen
to "Hamlet" when a perfectly fascinating
new world lay just a few yards away! But
Aunt Nell really was a dear&mdash;that new blue
taffeta was going to be stunning.</p>

<p>Judith had dreaded a little the interview
with Miss Meredith; she was sure that the
Head of this great School must be an awe-inspiring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
person, stern and somewhat like a
judge. But Miss Meredith's welcome was so
warm and gracious that Judith felt surprisingly
at her ease. She was conscious of a
dignified presence, kind yet keen blue eyes, a
beautiful, low-pitched voice, and a personality,
which, even in that first short interview, Judith
recognized as strong and powerful.</p>

<p>Judith's course of study was discussed, and
then a charming-looking girl&mdash;who was apparently
waiting in the corridor for the purpose&mdash;was
summoned and introduced as Nancy
Nairn, a classmate, and member of the same
house.</p>

<p>They made way for another newcomer and
her mother, and the moment Judith had
dreaded was come. She kept Aunt Nell a few
minutes in the hall sending messages to Doris
and Bobby and Uncle Tom, and a miserable
aching lump rose in her throat, though she swallowed
hard.</p>

<p>"Head up, honey," whispered Aunt Nell,
holding Judith's hands firmly. "Ask Miss
Marlowe to let you 'phone me if you need anything,
and on Friday I'll come for you. What
a lot you'll have to tell me!"</p>

<p>For one desperate instant Judith felt that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
she must follow her or else let the wretched
lump, which was growing larger and larger,
compel her to tears, but there at her elbow
was Nancy whose blue eyes were dancing and
who apparently had no sympathy for tears.</p>

<p>"Let's go over to South and see about your
room," she began. "Do you know any one
here?"</p>

<p>Judith shook her head.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, you'll soon know heaps. What
a perfectly sweet bag," she added tactfully,
surveying Judith's beaded treasure from Paris.
"Do let me see it."</p>

<p>Judith wondered if she could speak, but
Nancy didn't wait. Her soldier brother had
brought her a bag from Liberty's. Would
Judith come and see it? She did hope Judith's
room was near hers; at least hers was not a
room, but a cubicle. Judith's eyes questioned.
Cubicle had to be explained as a room with low
walls about six feet high, such a friendly place
to live in, "five or six of us in a row and we're
never lonely," finished Nancy; "but then no
one is lonely at York."</p>

<p>By this time they had crossed by a cloister
to South House and were standing at the
House Mistress's door.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"Miss Marlowe must be a very popular person,"
thought Judith. Outside the green baize
door was a chattering mob of girls, all apparently
talking at the top of their voices.
Indeed, it seemed to Judith that they were
screaming.</p>

<p>"Nancy, <i>darling!</i>" cried one, and Nancy
was literally dragged from Judith by several
impetuous young persons who all talked at
once.</p>

<p>"Glorious time .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Did you?" .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. "Temagami" .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. "camped
out for three weeks" .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. "Indian
guides" .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. "<i>Such</i> diving" .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. "Heavenly
time" .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. "Murray Bay" .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Then a louder voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Miss Marlowe wants Peggy Forrest."</p>

<p>"Here, Piggy, hurry along"&mdash;and a fat girl
was propelled through the crowd.</p>

<p>"Jane, my dear, I thought you were never
coming," heralded a new arrival.</p>

<p>"Miss Marlowe is a brick; we are to have
thirty-three."</p>

<p>Squeals of delight and the retreat of three
inseparables.</p>

<p>Judith began to feel that she would drown
amidst all the noise, but Nancy had a tight
grip of her arm again, and at last it was her
turn at the door.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Judith never lost that first picture of Miss
Marlowe in her study, a pleasant, sun-flooded
room, low bookcases, the gleam of brass, colorful
pictures, a cosy fire, and Miss Marlowe
herself, grey-eyed, ruddy-haired, and low-voiced.
The quiet voice began to work a magic,
and after a few minutes' chat Judith felt less
like a lost soul and more like a normal girl
again. Then Nancy was summoned from without.</p>

<p>"Judith is to be in number twenty-five,
Nancy; will you take her up and see that she
is settled? Her trunk is there already; it came
this morning. You can be very busy at
once, Judith"&mdash;and Miss Marlowe's smile
was friendly and comforting.</p>

<p>Nancy squeezed Judith's hand impulsively
as they left the room to make way for other
girls.</p>

<p>"Twenty-five! I <i>am</i> glad you are in our
set of cubicles."</p>

<p>Twenty-five proved to be the tiniest room
Judith had ever seen, more like a ship's cabin
than a room, she thought, surveying her new
abode with disfavour. A couch-bed, writing-desk
and bookcase, a bureau, a wicker chair&mdash;how
was there room for them all? And how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
dreadful to have only half a wall&mdash;well, three
quarters of a wall between you and your neighbour!</p>

<p>There were five of these little cubicles in a
row, she saw; then a closed door evidently
opening into a bedroom at the end, and the
six rooms had their own hall which was closed
off from the main corridor by a big door.</p>

<p>Judith unlocked her trunk and began to unpack
her treasures. Wherever was the clothes-closet?
Surely there was one?</p>

<p>In a few moments Nancy's voice was heard
again&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come and see my new evening frock before
I put it away."</p>

<p>Judith began to realize the advantages of a
cubicle. How nice to be able to talk to one's
neighbours in this friendly fashion&mdash;and a new
frock! Judith adored clothes, and she was
soon admiring <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Nancy'">Nancy's</ins> pet frock.</p>

<p>The cupboard was discovered, one of a row
in the hall, and the two spent a happy hour,
unpacking.</p>

<p>Nancy explained the use of the shelf on the
inside of the cupboard door to hold toilet articles,
and pointed out the towel bars and a wooden
locker for hats on the cupboard shelf.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's great luck," said Nancy, "to have our
trunks up so soon; we can get our things put
away before the others come, and then we'll
have plenty of time for visiting.</p>

<p>"I wonder who is coming to the other
rooms! I know Josephine Burley is trying to
get into this set of cubicles, but Miss Marlowe
has her own ideas about which rooms we're to
have.</p>

<p>"You'll love Miss Marlowe. She's a dear&mdash;strict,
you know, but just&mdash;and she helps
with the plays&mdash;she can act anything.
Aren't you glad you're in South? Of <i>course</i>
South is the crack house! We won the basket-ball
cup last year and our captain is School
Captain this year."</p>

<p>While they talked, they finished their unpacking,
and Judith, who was naturally very
orderly, soon had everything in its place. Her
mother's parting gift had been couch-cover,
cushions, and hangings for the new room&mdash;homespun
of a lovely deep blue for cover and
cushions, and a delightful rosy chintz for
hangings.</p>

<p>Judith was eager to see how her room would
look and worked quickly and deftly. She
was hanging her curtains when she heard excited<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
voices in the corridor, then a banging of
doors and screams of delight as the newcomers
found Nancy.</p>

<p>"Good work, Nancy," said some one in a
gruff voice. "How did you do it? I never
thought Miss Marlowe would let us three be
together again."</p>

<p>"My blameless character, Miss Josephine
Burley, did the trick," retorted Nancy. "I
pointed out to Miss Marlowe the good influence
living with me would have on a reprobate
like you."</p>

<p>"Reprobate! I like that," said the owner
of the deep, boyish voice, and sounds of scuffling
feet, the creaking of the bed, and bursts
of laughter proclaimed a tussle.</p>

<p>Nancy apparently had the worst of it, and
she was sat upon literally and heavily and then
fed with chocolates.</p>

<p>Scraps of conversation floated over the
walls:</p>

<p>"Rosamond's in thirty-seven&mdash;very, very
mad is Rosamond. Hope we'll have Pat as
prefect."</p>

<p>"No such luck. Pat is in number ten."</p>

<p>"There's a new girl in twenty-five"&mdash;this
from Nancy in a lowered voice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>In a moment there was a knock at the door
and Judith was introduced to the owner of the
deep voice, Josephine Burley, and her satellite,
Jane Fenton.</p>

<p>"Why, you've got your room fixed already,"
said Josephine admiringly. "Somebody's
been working hard! Look at her
lovely curtains! I wish I'd had rose now, instead
of yellow."</p>

<p>"'T wouldn't have made a speck of difference,
Jo, and you know it," commented Jane
with a wicked twinkle. "You know you say
you were made untidy, and untidy you'll stay."</p>

<p>"I promised Miss Marlowe I'd reform.
I'm not going to forget anything, and I'm
going to get a <i>beautiful</i> record for my room,
and my hair and clothes are going to be so
irreproachable that Miss Watson will have
nothing to do but create masterpieces all
term."</p>

<p>"Are we going to have Miss Marlowe for
English, by the way?" asked Jane. "I hope so.
And is Eleanor here yet? I've got to see her
about a new basket-ball."</p>

<p>"I never saw three girls so different,"
thought Judith as she sat eating chocolates
and listening to School gossip. "Nancy's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
much the prettiest&mdash;I love gold hair, and she
has such aristocratic hands and feet&mdash;she's
lovely&mdash;I do hope we'll be friends. Josephine's
almost rough&mdash;and what an untidy
mop of hair! I wonder if her eyes are brown&mdash;she
shuts them up so tight when she laughs
I can't see&mdash;and she seems to be laughing
most of the time. She's awfully big&mdash;I don't
think I'd like to be quite so tall. Jane's funny&mdash;she's
almost square&mdash;fair and solid&mdash;and
how straight her hair is; she's got a wicked
grin&mdash;she's a monkey, I do believe."</p>

<p>The dressing-bell rang before the three
friends had caught up on the latest news, but
thanks to the low walls conversation could
proceed even while they dressed. Nancy remembered
to ask Judith if she needed any
help with dome fasteners, and then they went
down to the dining-room together.</p>

<p>The tables were laid for six, each headed by
a sixth-form girl.</p>

<p>"At dinner we usually have a teacher at
each table," explained Nancy, "but this being
first night the staff are by themselves."</p>

<p>Judith was introduced to the prefect, Esther
Harriman, a tall, black-haired girl who enquired
at once what games Judith played, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
learning that she preferred tennis assured her
that she could have a game the next day.</p>

<p>Nancy continued to point out notables: the
brown-haired prefect at the next table with
the frank, boyish look was Eleanor Ormsby,
the Captain of the School, and next to her was
Rosamond&mdash;</p>

<p>Esther interrupted them in order to introduce
a newcomer who had arrived late, evidently
just from a journey.</p>

<p>"This is Sally May Forsythe, Nancy, from
Richmond, Virginia, and she's going to be in
your set of cubicles, Miss Marlowe says."</p>

<p>Sally May was almost as pretty as Nancy,
Judith decided, but not quite, though her eyes
were big and brown, and her soft Southern
voice wholly charming.</p>

<p>"We're to go back to Miss Marlowe's room
so she can talk over your schedule of lessons
with you," announced Nancy as they left the
dining-room, "and then we'll go over to the
gymnasium."</p>

<p>"Gymnasium?" gasped Judith.</p>

<p>"Oh, just for a dance," said Nancy, "It'll
be good fun. Wait for me in the corridor outside
Miss Marlowe's room."</p>

<p>It <i>was</i> good fun, Judith decided a little later<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
as she had her first dance with Nancy, and
then with Sally May&mdash;but bewildering.
There had been only about fifty girls in the
dining-room at South, and even there she had
been confused by the number of voices, but
here the whole School, some two hundred girls,
were gathered, and there was a perfect Babel
of sound.</p>

<p>Nancy piloted them back to South, and as
Sally May's luggage had not come she was
fitted out with what she needed. Nancy went
to the housekeeper's room for soap and a toothbrush&mdash;Mrs.
Bronson kept a supply for such
emergencies; Josephine donated her best cr&ecirc;pe
nightie&mdash;in which Sally May was presently
to look quite lost, so large was it; and Judith
got out her newest and prettiest kimono.</p>

<p>"You'll feel as if you'd been here all your
life by the time you get all these and my old
bath slippers on," said Jane saucily. "Come
into my room as soon as you're arrayed in
all this glory&mdash;there's a little cake left and
I'm going to do my best to find some ginger-ale."</p>

<p>Judith was brushing out her pretty brown
hair and looking rather solemnly at her reflection
in the mirror when shrieks of delight testified<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
to the arrival of some one, who, to judge
by the commotion, must be very popular.</p>

<p>"Cathy, you darling, are you <i>really</i> to be
ours? What precious luck!&mdash;Josephine and
Jane, and&mdash;yes&mdash;two new girls&mdash;Judith
Benson in twenty-five and Sally May Forsythe
in twenty-one."</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door and a clear
voice said, "May I come in?"</p>

<p>Judith opened her door and straightway lost
her heart when the newcomer smiled a welcome.
Catherine was adored by every beauty-loving
girl in the School, for she had beauty of
a rare type&mdash;a slender, graceful body, a well-set
little head crowned with a big braid of
softly waving dark brown hair, and haunting,
black-lashed Irish blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Isn't she simply lovely?" whispered Nancy
after Catherine had gone to her own room.
"And she's just as good as she looks. Oh,
goody, I'm <i>so</i> glad she's our prefect!"</p>

<p>Miss Marlowe put her head in the door to say
good-night just before the "Lights out" bell
rang, and then Judith was at last alone. She
was bewildered by the mass of new impressions;
the twinkling of the trainman's lanterns
as she looked out of her berth in the early<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
morning; the cold, chilly touch of homesickness
when she followed the porter out of the Pullman;
Aunt Nell's welcome; the exciting shopping;
the first glimpse of the school set high
on the hill; Aunt Nell's little sermon; Nancy's
merry eyes; the Babel of voices in the gymnasium;
Catherine Ellison's beautiful face; her
mother's proud good-bye, "I can trust you,
Judy, darling&mdash;"</p>

<p>Suddenly Judith realized that Mother and
Daddy were many hundreds of miles away, that
Aunt Nell had gone, and that she was alone,
alone with these hundreds of strangers. The
thought terrified her: the ache in her throat
grew intolerable: she would have to sob and
disgrace herself.</p>

<p>There was a rustling of paper on the other
side of the partition, and then&mdash;</p>

<p>"Catch," said Josephine in a hoarse whisper,
and something dropped on to Judith's
bed.</p>

<p>"Catch," came in a shriller whisper from
the other side, and a second something followed.</p>

<p>Judith groped for them in surprise and discovered
a chocolate bar and a huge sticky
Chelsea bun wrapped in tissue paper.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Promised Cathy we wouldn't have a picnic
to-night," said Nancy, "but we didn't say
that we wouldn't sit up in bed like little ladies
and partake of some light refreshment."</p>

<p>Sheer surprise made it possible for Judith
to say, "Thank you." A moment ago she
would have felt one word was an impossibility
and then&mdash;oh, blessed bun!&mdash;one cannot sob
and eat a large Chelsea bun at the same time.</p>

<p>Judith ate slowly and carefully, set her lips,
and kept back the miserable lump. The chocolate
was still to finish, and Jane began an
interminable story of a canoe trip in Algonquin
Park, but before it was nearly ended,
tired Judith was fast asleep.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>IMPORTANT THINGS</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> never forgot morning prayers on the
first day of school at York Hill. In some
miraculous way the throng of girls, who
crowded the corridors before nine o'clock,
formed in lines at the doors of their old classrooms,
new girls were piloted to a special position,
and when the prayer-bell rang, an orderly
procession, beginning with the little "Removes"
and ending with the serious and important-looking
Sixth Form, filed into Big
Hall and took their places.</p>

<p>The beautiful arching Gothic windows, the
soft music from the pipe organ, the dignity
of the high, oak-beamed ceiling, all this to
Judith's beauty-loving mind was curiously
satisfying. The service was short but reverent;
a hymn, the reading of the lesson, the
prayers for the day, and then the Head Mistress
was reading out the promotion of old
girls and the placing of new girls.</p>

<p>Form Five A was announced; "Judith<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Benson, Josephine Burley, Sally May Forsythe,
Joyce Hewson, Nancy Nairn, Frances
Purdy"&mdash;Judith's cheeks glowed as the list
was read. Five A! How pleased Daddy
would be, and how glad she was that she had
stuck to the hated mathematics this summer!
And to be in Nancy's form, what joy!</p>

<p>Then followed a busy morning; new books
piled high on the waiting desk, new teachers,
each seemingly more interesting than the last,
new rules to be learned, new girls to meet.</p>

<p>Judith was quite ready for buns and milk
at eleven-thirty and enjoyed her fifteen minutes
in the open, and by the end of the morning
she was both tired and stimulated, for she
found that she was required to think for herself
in order to take part in the discussions.
There was to be a written test to-morrow on
the books which had been set for Form Five
A's summer reading and Judith had thought
that she was prepared for it. But as Miss
Marlowe proceeded with her keen questioning,
Judith began to wonder if she knew anything
at all about "The Idylls of the King." Miss
Marlowe had a way of saying, when answers
were given, "Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;what do <i>you</i> yourself
think?" which Judith, accustomed to teachers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
who had spoken with a voice of authority,
found disconcerting but highly interesting.</p>

<p>After luncheon and a rest period, Nancy
took Judith for a tour of inspection; tennis
courts, cricket field, gymnasium, common room,
and library were visited in turn, the etiquette
of the stairs explained&mdash;Judith learned that
it was considered fearful "side" for a Fifth-Form
girl to use the front stairway to the entrance
hall&mdash;and the round ended in the tuck
shop where Judith was introduced to the
presiding genius&mdash;Mrs. Wilcox, the housekeeper's
sister&mdash;a bright-eyed, cheerful little
Englishwoman, who, to judge by the way the
girls greeted her, was immensely popular.</p>

<p>Sally May and Josephine hailed them from
a coveted table by the west window, and the
four of them were soon busily and happily
engaged with peach sundaes and the
foibles and peculiarities of teachers new and
old.</p>

<p>The four-thirty bell caused a hasty scattering:
Judith was enrolled in music and studio
classes and introduced to study hour in the
library.</p>

<p>It <i>was</i> a busy day. Judith, as she drifted
off into the sleep that claimed her before she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
had time to think over the events of the
last twenty-four hours, wondered drowsily
whether she had been at York a day or a week,
and however was she going to tell Mother and
Daddy <i>all</i> about it as she had promised!</p>

<p>By the end of the week the new girls had
been so well shepherded by the old that Judith
had lost her first shyness and bewilderment at
living with so many new people, and was beginning
to feel that she herself was an old girl
and ready to uphold and defend York Hill
traditions. Everything had so far been made
so easy for her that she had lost sight of Aunt
Nell's cryptic remarks concerning the important
things that the girls were to teach her.
But the week was not to end without the beginning
of the discipline Aunt Nell had been
thinking about.</p>

<p>When Nancy and Judith ran upstairs after
luncheon on Friday, Judith was surprised to
find on her bedroom door a card. There was
one on Josephine's too.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," groaned that young person,
"bedroom inspection already! And I left my
boots under my bed last night. 'C,' of course,
and I did want to have at least 'B's' this term.
What've you got, Judy?" And looking over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Judith's shoulder she read aloud, "A. Excellent.
A pretty room in exquisite order."</p>

<p>"My word, Judy, you're in Miss Watson's
good books all right. Did you hear that,
Cathy?"&mdash;as their prefect appeared in her
door dressed for going out, "Judy has 'A'
on her card."</p>

<p>"Splendid," said Catherine approvingly; "I
wish the rest of you would take Judith's room
as a model. You may thank your lucky star,
Sally May," she continued as Sally May
joined them, "that Miss Watson hadn't time
to inspect your room. It's in a shocking state.
Run along now and have things ship-shape by
dinner-time."</p>

<p>"Isn't she simply lovely?" breathed Sally
May when Catherine had gone; "I'd do <i>anything</i>
in this world for her. But I don't see
how I could <i>ever</i> be tidy. I never looked after
my things before and there's <i>so</i> little space in
these tiny rooms."</p>

<p>"They certainly are tiny," agreed Judith.
"I couldn't think of anything but a cabin on
board ship when I saw mine."</p>

<p>"Well, if Cathy wants us to be tidy, we've
just got to be," said Nancy with finality, and
Josephine and Jane were summoned to help<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
eat the last of Judith's chocolates, and lend
their brains to a scheme "for furthering extreme
and painful neatness," as Sally May
put it.</p>

<p>"We might have a box for fines," suggested
Josephine hopefully.</p>

<p>"I have it!" cried Nancy. "Judith's idea
of the cabin was an inspiration. Let's pretend
we <i>are</i> a ship. Cathy'll be the captain
and we'll be the crew and we'll have to be
disciplined if we're not orderly."</p>

<p>Nancy's plan was received with enthusiasm,
chiefly because, since sororities were not permitted
in the school, it gave them a chance to
band themselves together. They had great fun
discussing a name before they finally settled on
Josephine's suggestion of the "Jolly Susan."
"'Jolly,' because we <i>are</i> jolly, and 'Susan,'
because, well&mdash;don't you think of 'Susan' as
tidy, and a ship?"</p>

<p>So the cubicles were formally christened the
"Jolly Susan" by Jane, who donated a bottle
of ginger-ale for the purpose, and Judith's
empty candy-box was hung up beside Catherine's
door to hold the fines which were to be
used "for the sustenance of disabled (or dejected)
seamen."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Sally May entreated Judith to show her
how she managed to stow away all her belongings
so neatly, and when the half-past two
bell rang for outdoor recreation, the "Jolly
Susan" was ready for Captain Catherine's
inspection.</p>

<p>A basket-ball practice for South House had
been posted on the bulletin board, but Judith
felt lazy and wanted to finish "The Scarlet
Pimpernel," so, taking her book, she went
across the quadrangle to a sheltered spot under
the big beech tree where she meant to spend a
blissful hour reading and lying at her ease on
the soft warm grass.</p>

<p>The story would be sure to be interesting,
but she postponed the treat and lay watching
the big white clouds sailing lazily across the
blue of the sky, and enjoying the brilliant
splashes of colour in the maples at the foot of
the garden.</p>

<p>It had been a very happy week, Judith decided,
reviewing the events which she planned
to chronicle in her letter to her mother to-night.
How nice everybody had been to her! No one
could have a better chum than Nancy! How
pleased Mother would be that she had received
such an excellent mark for her room; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Daddy would be delighted at the high mark
Miss Marlowe had given her on that initial
literature test; Nancy and Josephine were loud
in their admiration of the way she had translated
for Miss Langton in Latin class. Altogether,
as Judith rolled over on to her elbows
and found the place in her book, she was feeling
happy and a bit too complacent. Only a
page or two had been turned when a shadow
blotted out the flickering tracings of the beech
leaves, and a surprised voice said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hullo, aren't you Judith Benson of
South?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Judith, sitting up and smiling
politely, unconsciously ready for a little more
praise: she knew that this was Catherine's
friend, Patricia Caldwell, another South
House prefect.</p>

<p>"Well, then, why aren't you playing basket-ball?"</p>

<p>"Because I don't want to play," said Judith
calmly; "I prefer tennis."</p>

<p>Patricia almost gasped; this from a new
girl&mdash;"She didn't want to!"</p>

<p>"Every girl is expected to join in the first
practice matches so we can pick our players
for South," she said pleasantly but firmly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
"Weren't you at the Athletic Union meeting
on Wednesday? I suppose you didn't understand.
However, you can join in the second
half."</p>

<p>Patricia was Senior basket-ball captain and
secretary of the Athletic Union, and basket-ball
was to her at present the most important
thing in the School. Judith felt rebellious, but
made no reply. She watched Patricia's retreating
figure and wondered whether she dare
skip the practice.</p>

<p>Nancy, who had come to look for her, was
questioned.</p>

<p>"Skip it? You had better not!" she exclaimed
in horrified tones.</p>

<p>"But it isn't on my time-table," objected
Judith. "Mayn't I do as I please in spare
time?"</p>

<p>"Why, but Patricia said you must," said
Nancy.</p>

<p>Nancy, brought up in the traditions of York
Hill, felt that it was almost sacrilegious to
question the authority of a senior prefect.</p>

<p>Judith was aggrieved and a bit defiant. She
wanted to finish her story. It was extremely
pleasant out under the beech trees. She didn't
want to get up and dash about getting all hot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
and untidy, and making all kinds of mistakes
in a silly old game that did nobody any good
as far as she could see. Anyhow, her afternoon
was spoiled now, and she began to wish
that basket-ball had never been invented.
The very idea of action grew more and more
distasteful, but at the sound of the three o'clock
bell she got up very reluctantly and crossed
over to the basket-ball court. Fortunately
she was dressed ready for the game, since at
four o'clock she was due at a gymnasium class.</p>

<p>Esther Harriman, who was umpiring, gave
her a red scarf to tie on her arm and briefly
explained where she was to play and what she
was to do. Unfortunately the girl she was to
check was Georgia Fisher for whom Judith
had taken an unreasonable dislike; partly because
she disliked the way Georgia giggled,
and partly because she thought her impossibly
stupid. Judith hadn't much patience with
stupid people!</p>

<p>"No, I haven't played much," Judith said
loftily in answer to Georgia's question. "I
don't care about basket-ball&mdash;I'd sooner play
tennis. Last year I won the tennis prize."
Georgia wasn't to think that she, Judith,
couldn't play games if she wanted to.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Esther blew her whistle, and instantly the
two centres were leaping for the ball, and before
Judith could remember that she was supposed
to be on guard Georgia quite easily
caught the ball, and passed it neatly to Josephine
who threw for the basket and made the
first score for the Blue scarves.</p>

<p>Judith looked annoyed and Georgia giggled,
sympathetically.</p>

<p>"You got to keep your eye on me, <i>and</i> on
the ball," she explained good-humouredly, and
proceeded to take the ball again in spite of
Judith's utmost endeavors to prevent her.</p>

<p>An exhausting half-hour followed. Georgia
seemed to be <i>all</i> arms, thought Judith despairingly,
trying in vain to check her. Once she
did get the coveted ball, and in the excitement
of at last outwitting Georgia, she threw it
straight into the outstretched arms of Josephine
who wore the enemy's Blue scarf. Josephine
threw her a kiss of thanks when the ball was
safely landed in the net, and Georgia's unfailing
giggle helped to heighten the colour in Judith's
cheeks.</p>

<p>Up went the ball again and then swiftly
it came, passed from one Red scarf to another.
"I <i>will</i> have it this time," said Judith<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
fiercely to herself, too engrossed in a desire to
win from the Blues to remember the most elementary
rules of the game; she caught the
ball and ran, yes, just ran to the goal and
threw. The proverbial good luck which attends
the beginner was hers, but instead of
the applause which Judith expected there was a
burst of good-natured laughter. She had run
with the ball and all in order to throw it into
the Blues' goal!</p>

<p>Poor Judith, it was all she could do to smile
feebly when Georgia met her with a grin, and,
"This ain't football, you know." She hated
being laughed at, and when the practice was
finally over, left the campus humiliated, cross,
and hardly able to bear herself or any one
else.</p>

<p>On the way back to the beech tree and the
story-book, she consulted her time-table to
make sure of the time of the gymnasium class.
Yes! thank goodness, she was free until four
o'clock&mdash;there was just time to finish the
chapter.</p>

<p>Four o'clock found Judith in line, a pair of
dumb-bells tucked under her arms, ready to
march into the gymnasium as the three-thirty
class marched out. She had had two lessons<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
already and was beginning to like her class.
Last year's instructor had been adored by the
girls and consequently their work was excellent.
Miss Evans, a young teacher, new to
York Hill, busy finding out what her new
classes could do, scarcely realized how much
<i>she</i> was on trial. This afternoon she called out
a last year's girl to lead the class while she
stood aside to watch and criticize.</p>

<p>"Wrong, wrong," she cried, and held up her
hand as figure five was concluded. Now Miss
Evans, as we said, was young and new at her
job, and did not count on the adoration which
the girls had given her predecessor.</p>

<p>"Quite wrong," she said again.</p>

<p>"That is the way we did last year, Miss
Evans," stiffly replied Jane who was leading.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Miss Evans, who did not
like Jane's tone; "that doesn't make it right.
Is there any one here who belonged to another
class who can do this figure correctly?"</p>

<p>Alas, Miss Evans, your Irish impetuosity
will cost you dear! Condemnation shone forth
from thirty pairs of eyes, the hot, unreasoning
condemnation of the young. Alas, Miss
Evans, it will take you many a day to recapture
what you have just lost! Alas, poor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Judith, here was the opportunity to regain her
lost self-complacency. It happened that she
had been taught figure five in a different fashion,
and, eager to show that she at least knew
how, her hand went up.</p>

<p>"Ah, Judith knows how? Judith, stand out
and do the figure."</p>

<p>The music began and Judith went through
it accurately and perfectly, entirely to her own
satisfaction and to that of Miss Evans.</p>

<p>"Good," said Miss Evans, "that's right.
Now once more, Judith, so that the others may
follow."</p>

<p>Judith's eyes flew to Nancy's. She loved to
see the admiring affection which she had been
finding there. But Nancy's eyes were cold and
unseeing. Judith, like most clever little girls,
was extremely sensitive to public opinion, and
she almost dropped her dumb-bells in an agony
of shame and humiliation as she saw the coldness
of Nancy's eyes faithfully repeated in
all the eyes about her. Alas, poor Judith!
"Teacher's pet," terrible phrase, was whispered
as the class filed out, and when Nancy
and Josephine rushed down to the tuck shop for
an ice-cream cone they affected not to see
Judith, who at first followed disconsolately,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and then fled to her room, where, with head
buried under the pillows, she sobbed herself
into a misery of self-pity and supposed homesickness.</p>

<p>Five o'clock bell rang. Horrors! She had
forgotten that Aunt Nell was to be here at
five o'clock to take her out for dinner. Aunt
Nell would be cross at being kept waiting. Oh,
dear! Oh, dear! Would she never find her
gloves? Where was her new scarf? She must
have left them down in the cloakroom after
morning walk. A hurried flight to the cloakroom,
another search, and an entirely discomfited
Judith presented herself in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Aunt Nell would look displeased, she
thought, as she entered. Judith really did not
care that Aunt Nell had been inconvenienced,
but merely that disapproval, instead of the approbation
for which she thirsted, would be her
portion. But Aunt Nell looked amused. Indeed,
when they were once in the motor she
laughed outright.</p>

<p>"I must say, Judy, considering that you have
been in school only a week, you seem to
have got rid of any superfluous neatness very
quickly." And she pointed to a mirror at the
side of the car.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Judith's eyes rounded with horror; she had
washed her face, but a grimy streak still outlined
one side of her chin, her hair was rough
in spite of a hasty brushing, and her hat was
comically askew.</p>

<p>"I have been so busy," said Judith, turning
scarlet and blinking to keep back the tears of
mortification at this last straw.</p>

<p>"Busy!" said Aunt Nell quizzically; "busy
learning important things?"</p>

<p>"Very important things," said Judith.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>DRESSING UP</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Got</span> your costume ready for to-night, Judy?"
asked Nancy one glorious sunshiny morning a
few weeks later.</p>

<p>"I have <i>not</i>," came from Judith in dismayed
tones; "I absolutely forgot about it. Why
didn't you remind me? I haven't heard any
one mention it all week."</p>

<p>"Well, there hasn't really been time to do
anything, has there? And, anyway, we usually
concoct something at the last minute. I do love
dressing up, don't you?"</p>

<p>"I do if I don't have to make up the dress,"
said Judith honestly, as she finished making her
bed and leaned out of the window to take deep
breaths of the glorious October air. "Nancy,
do come and look at the maple grove, and the
oaks and the beeches against that lovely sky,
and isn't the vine on Miss Meredith's house
simply a gorgeous colour? I could almost eat
the sunshine, it's so good. Tell me what to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
wear to-night. I don't know what I should
have done without your help last Friday."</p>

<p>"Let's think it over," said Nancy, pulling
on a sweater and cap and running off to play
tennis with Jane; "see you at recess and we'll
decide then."</p>

<p>But when recess came Judith confessed to
not having given it a thought, she had been
kept too busy for the consideration of such
frivolities as a Friday party, and Nancy on
her part had a doleful tale of returned lessons
to be made up during the afternoon.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>why</i> didn't I prepare that French
prose?" she wailed when the crew of the "Jolly
Susan" foregathered after luncheon in her
room. "I begged Madame to let me make it up
<i>any</i> other time, but of course she wouldn't."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, we're not going to dress alike
this time," said Sally May, "so it doesn't
matter. It <i>was</i> fun, though, wasn't it, making
sailor-boy costumes out of sheets and pillowcases,
and I never laughed so hard in my life
as when North House came in. You really
ought to have seen them"&mdash;this to Jane who
had been away for the week-end&mdash;"not one
of them looked more than six months old&mdash;they
pasted paper over their teeth and had on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the cutest little bonnets and long dresses and
carried bottles&mdash;really cold-cream bottles
with a glove finger on top&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think the Hindus were the cleverest,"
said Judith.</p>

<p>"The question before the house is, what are
we going to do to-night?" observed Josephine.
"Now my idea"&mdash;</p>

<p>But what Josephine's idea was the rest
never knew, for Rosamond put her head in at
the door and called, "Long distance 'phone
for you, Jo; Miss Martin says hurry"&mdash;</p>

<p>Judging by the speed with which Josephine
vanished down the corridor she was anxious to
oblige Miss Martin.</p>

<p>The half-past two bell rang and Nancy and
Judith went off to music lessons without deciding
anything about the costume for the party,
and when Judith came upstairs after an early
dinner she was still as undecided as ever.
The corridor was as busy as the proverbial
beehive, for the "borrowing-rule" had been
suspended for the day, and everybody seemed
to be making the most of the opportunity.</p>

<p>Judith was besieged with requests the
moment she appeared.</p>

<p>"I bag your white slippers, Judy, if <i>you</i>
don't want them," called Rosamond.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"And I want your black beads&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your blue scarf, please, Judy," called
Catherine from her room, "I'll be awfully
careful of it."</p>

<p>Squeals of delight came from the various
rooms where tryings-on were proceeding.
"Every one seems happy but me," thought
Judith dismally when the borrowers had departed.</p>

<p>What would a Southern costume be like,
anyway? Africa? No that would be too hard
and she hadn't the least idea how the Australians
dressed. South America? India? Was
India south? No, it couldn't be, because she
had heard Audrey Green of East House describing
a perfectly sweet Hindu costume
which her roommate was going to wear.
Southerner? How stupid of her! Why not a
Virginian lady of the Colonial period? Why
not? That's settled. Now as to the how;
whom could she ask? But no sympathetic
friend presented herself and Judith again
began to feel aggrieved.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! hurrah!" cried Josephine excitedly
rushing into the room. "Jim&mdash;my
brother&mdash;arrives to-night from Alberta and
he'll call here to-morrow first thing. I believe,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
she added in a lower, confidential tone,
"I believe I must have been a bit homesick
and didn't know it&mdash;there'll be letters and
messages, and probably a box, too, from home.
Oh, I can hardly wait till to-morrow! Jim says
Mother is all right, though she misses me
dreadfully&mdash;you see our nearest neighbour
lives fifty miles away, and sometimes she
doesn't see a white woman all winter."</p>

<p>"Fifty miles!" repeated Judith in amazement.</p>

<p>"Yes, we have to have a lot of land for the
horses, and sometimes Dad is away for several
days visiting the outlying parts and Mother
gets pretty lonely."</p>

<p>"You're joking, Jo&mdash;your father couldn't
spend several days travelling on his own
farm."</p>

<p>"Not farm, Judibus," said Josephine, laughing,
"it's a ranch, and it has to be big, as I
said, for the horses."</p>

<p>"How big?" demanded Judith, still thinking
of the farms she had seen in Ontario and
Quebec.</p>

<p>"We had twenty-five thousand acres last
year, but Dad has leased another ten thousand
on the other side of the river. Oh, Judy, my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
dear, if ever you come to the West I'll show
you what real fun is! Sometimes I ride all
day&mdash;and such riding! I've a gem of a little
mare&mdash;Patsy's her name&mdash;she's as good a
chum as I ever had until I came here last year.
Aren't mothers bricks?" she added with a little
catch in her voice. "Mother really needs me,
but she just insisted on my coming&mdash;she
taught me in her spare time until I came here
last year, and because spare time wasn't plentiful
there are big gaps in what I know, and as
I'm stupid to begin with, the lessons sometimes
seem so hard that I just want to give up and
run home. But of course I'm not going to,"
she finished, laughing at Judith's sober face;
"that <i>would</i> be a poor way to say 'thank you'
to my blessed <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'litle'">little</ins> mother. What are you
going to be to-night?"</p>

<p>"A Colonial lady from Virginia," answered
Judith superbly.</p>

<p>"Good&mdash;isn't that funny? I'm going to be
be a Virginian Colonel. Let's be partners.
Molly was to be mine, but she certainly can't
go with a sprained ankle. We'd better get
busy&mdash;there isn't much time left." And Josephine
disappeared into her own cubicle where
Judith could hear her opening and closing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
drawers and singing in her funny boyish voice
their new nonsense song:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Of all the ships that sail on land,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">There's none like 'Jolly Susan.'</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Her crew works well with heart and hand,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And sometimes they're amusin'."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Sally May and Jane whirled into the "Jolly
Susan" like small hurricanes in time to sing
the verse over again, and then the snatches of
talk she could hear told Judith that her neighbours
were thoroughly enjoying the fascinating
business of dressing up, and had evidently
forgotten all about her.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was a little reaction after several
weeks of new and exciting experiences; perhaps
Josephine's reference to mothers being
"bricks"; whatever it was Judith felt lonely
and homesick. She didn't know how to make
her costume; she didn't think of Sally May,
and she hated to confess to Josephine&mdash;to
whom, it must be confessed, she had always felt
a little superior&mdash;that she hadn't a ghost of a
notion how to make, out of nothing at all, the
dress of a Virginian lady of fashion.</p>

<p>But although Josephine had convulsed the
class and enraged Madame Phillippe by translating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
<i>hors de combat</i> as "war-horse," and although
her ideas as to angles and triangles
were so hazy as to be of no service to her in
a geometry class, she was not at all stupid
where her fellow humans were concerned, and
she had seen the quickly restrained quiver on
Judith's lips when mothers were mentioned.</p>

<p>"I guess she's homesick and doesn't know
it," said Josephine to herself. "I'd better
buck her up a bit and give her a good time."
But because she had a generous admiration
of Judith's cleverness she never thought of
offering her any suggestions as to how to put
her costume together.</p>

<p>A little later she appeared in Judith's doorway
in black tights, blue silk stockings, buckled
shoes (cardboard buckles covered with silver
paper), a white shirt blouse buttoned high,
and a long black ribbon in her hand.</p>

<p>"Please wind it round my neck, Judy, several
times as high up as you can. Why, where
is your dress?" she asked in surprise.</p>

<p>Poor, proud Judith, how she hated to confess
that she simply could not think of anything.
But the despised Josephine rose to the
occasion: she took charge with an assurance
which immediately dispelled Judith's gloom.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"Colonial lady&mdash;um&mdash;you will look awfully
nice with your hair powdered&mdash;let me
see&mdash;your chintz curtains will do for panniers&mdash;put
on your frilliest blouse and a white
skirt, pull down your curtains, and I'll drape
you in a minute or two."</p>

<p>Josephine was as good as her word. Blouse
and skirt by means of an overdrape of window
curtain were made into the dress of a lady of
quality; Judith's pretty hair was piled high
and liberally powdered with talcum, and Josephine
even produced a tiny bit of rouge and
a black patch, and insisted that to make the
picture complete Judith must have the buckled
shoes, and as there wasn't time to make more
buckles she'd wear her old pumps.</p>

<p>Josephine was having such a good time admiring
the result of her handiwork that Judith
accepted the shoes with a good grace, and off
they went to join the throng in the Big Hall.
So successful had Josephine been that Judith
had quite a little triumph as she entered the
hall on her colonel's arm, for she had discarded
the spectacles she wore during school hours, and
the powder and rouge had discovered a hitherto
unnoticed pair of beautiful arching eyebrows,
and altogether her appearance was so distinguished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
that numbers of girls turned to ask,
"Who's that pretty Virginian with Jo?"</p>

<p>It <i>was</i> a thrilling evening. Indeed, it is to
be doubted whether bona-fide balls of later
years would ever bring such thrills and such
intoxicating happiness to the Pierrots and
Pierrettes, gypsies and Arabs, Spanish dancers
and flower girls, Elizabethan ladies and
cavaliers, Red Cross nurses and college dons,
Indian chiefs and squaws, cowboys and "habitant"
girls, who were so thoroughly enjoying
themselves.</p>

<p>Judith laughed and danced away her blues,
and to all the compliments paid her was glad
to be able to say with honest admiration, "Oh,
<i>I</i> couldn't do it&mdash;Josephine did&mdash;isn't she
just <i>wonderful?</i>"</p>

<p>And when, after "the loveliest party ever,"
Judith tucked up in bed and her thoughts ran
to the absent mother, instead of tears she smiled
happily and whispered, "What a <i>lot</i> of nice
people there are in the world, mummy, dear&mdash;I've
got an awful lot to learn&mdash;but I'm going
to try <i>hard</i> to be unselfish and kind like
Josephine and Nancy."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>A SUPPER PARTY</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Oh</span>, goody!" Judith heard Nancy saying,
"isn't it splendid that it came on Friday! We
never have anything but buns and milk after
a Friday night lecture. Your mother is an
<i>angel</i>, Sally May; she must have guessed that
this was going to be a Friday without a party."</p>

<p>"That you, Judy?" came in Sally May's
pretty voice; "come on in." And Judith was
soon seated on Sally May's couch.</p>

<p>The crew of the "Jolly Susan" were invited,
she learned, to partake of an elegant cold collation
consisting of roast chicken, meringues,
cakes, candies, etc., etc., which Sally May's
mother was thoughtfully sending them from a
caterer in town.</p>

<p>"Have you asked Miss Marlowe if we may
have the small sitting-room?" asked Nancy
after Judith had been informed of the feast
awaiting her.</p>

<p>"Asked&mdash;Miss Marlowe?" gasped Sally
May; "well, of all the queer schools! Ask a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
teacher if we may have a midnight supper?
Well, I reckon <i>not!</i>"</p>

<p>"Why, that's the way we do," returned
Nancy; "the lecture will be over early and then
we'll go up to the sitting-room and have our
feed."</p>

<p>"Oh, that," said Sally May, "is ridiculous
and no fun at all. Why, at Knowlton Manor
we always waited until twelve o'clock, at least,
and had our feasts in the loveliest places. Once
we had supper in the cellar, and the engineer
caught us and we had a terrible time bribing
him; and last June, at Miss Gray's school, five
of us were caught in the teachers' own sitting-room
at three <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>"</p>

<p>Her hearers looked horrified enough to satisfy
even Sally May, who loved to tell a story,
and she related one epic after another, until
the York audience were convinced that life
would not be worth living unless they too could
recount similar tales when they went home for
the Christmas vacation.</p>

<p>Miss Marlowe and her rules were forgotten,
and they laid their plans for a midnight supper.</p>

<p>"But Miss Marlowe knows that your box
has arrived," objected practical Nancy.</p>

<p>"Then we'll buy some buns at tuck and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
have a <i>camouflage</i> supper after the lecture,
and the real one at midnight," retorted Sally
May, not to be done out of her scheme.</p>

<p>"I wish we could ask Cathy, don't you?"
said Josephine; "she's been such a dear that
it seems a shame to have a glorification without
her."</p>

<p>Catherine, hard at work at her desk in her
own room, caught the sound of her name, and
the next sentence in an excited voice revealed
the fact that a midnight supper was being
planned for that very night. Her first impulse,
of course, was to tell the crew that she
had unwittingly overheard them, and use her
influence as captain and prefect to stop the
whole proceeding; and then, because she was
taking her duties as a prefect very seriously,
she stopped to consider the little escapade in a
new light.</p>

<p>Sally May, Catherine could see, was going
to be troublesome. Already she had chafed at
several time-honoured rules and customs, for
her sense of reverence for traditions had been
stifled by her ceaseless change of residence, and
Sally May was becoming exceedingly popular.
Her soft Southern voice, with its delicious inflections
and its lazy drawl, was most persuasive.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
The crew of the "Jolly Susan" had so
far been a model crew and Catherine had not
yet had to enforce discipline, but at the last
prefects' meeting Sally May had been mentioned
as the cause of two practical jokes perpetrated
in other parts of the house, and,
"Such things are not done, they are simply
not done," said the School captain severely;
"Catherine, you must take Sally May in
hand." Perhaps this was her chance. She
waited until the four o'clock bell scattered the
conspirators to practising and gymnasium
classes and then went down to the captain's
study.</p>

<p>"Come in," said a clear ringing voice as
Catherine knocked at Eleanor's door; "you're
just in time for tea&mdash;here, you toast the crumpets
and I'll brew the tea."</p>

<p>"Wait a jiffy and I'll get some jam&mdash;wild
strawberry with crumpets is heavenly."</p>

<p>Catherine was back in the specified jiffy,
and in a few moments the two friends were
chatting comfortably over their tea-cups.</p>

<p>York Hill like most modern schools had
adopted a modified form of self-government.
Each of the four Houses had its quota of prefects
appointed by the staff, and a House captain;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the Senior House captain was known as
the Captain of the School, and this year South
House had the honour of providing the School
Captain&mdash;Eleanor Ormsby. The prefects,
usually members of the various Sixth Forms,
were girls who had shown themselves worthy
of responsibility and privilege and who could
be trusted to set the tone of the School.</p>

<p>Eleanor Ormsby was deservedly popular:
there was a frankness and a directness about
her almost boyishly clear-cut face which inspired
confidence, and the girls who brought
their difficulties to her found in her a wise and
sympathetic counsellor. Eleanor was not
beautiful like Catherine, not brilliant like Patricia&mdash;in
fact it was with difficulty that she
held her place in the Sixth-Form classes, but
on basket-ball court, hockey-rink, or gymnasium
floor she had no rival. Above all she was
a born leader, and having spent all her school
days at York was steeped in its traditions and
ideals.</p>

<p>Just now Eleanor was keen upon getting
the two plays given just before the Christmas
vacation well started before the busy time at
the end of term: it was the custom for the Old
Girls to entertain the New Girls at a play and
for the New Girls to return the compliment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>So the absorbing topic of Queen's new hockey
coach being exhausted for the time being,
"Got any good stuff for the play in your cubicles,
Cathy?" asked Eleanor; "looks to me as
if they are a nice lively little bunch. What a
little witch Sally May is, and what lovely eyes
Judy has! I'm glad she and Nancy are such
pals&mdash;they make a good team."</p>

<p>"They're darlings, all of 'em," said Catherine
enthusiastically; "but 'not too good for
human nature's daily food.'" And she unfolded
the plan for the midnight supper.</p>

<p>"Well, of course," said Eleanor, laughing
reminiscently, "you couldn't expect them to
go home for the holidays without a story of
some such adventure as that. Remember the
time we went down to the gym and Pat fell
over the dumb-bell rack."</p>

<p>"And it was such a mean supper to get punished
for," added Catherine, grinning; "only
cold baked beans and apples. The trouble is
that Miss Marlowe is death on suppers since
Christine Dawson caught pneumonia last year
when they climbed out on to the sun-parlour
roof, and of course now that I know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course we'll have to do something.
But what?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Various plans were discussed, but nothing
satisfied their desire for poetic justice until
suddenly Catherine exclaimed: "I've got it!
Let them have their supper, and then we'll
make them wish they hadn't&mdash;let's lock the
door of the common room (that's where they
mean to go) and give them a good long time
in which to repent of their sins. I've got the
key&mdash;Miss Marlowe loaned it me for the dress
rehearsals."</p>

<p>"Good," said Eleanor. "I'll see that the
windows are kept shut during the evening so
that they won't catch cold, and I'll oil the lock
at tea-time."</p>

<p>And in spite of the solemnity befitting prefects,
their eyes danced as they pictured the
dismay of the young sinners when they discovered
themselves caught; for prefects, notwithstanding
their dignity and general "high
and mightiness," are not by any means above
a bit of a lark themselves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>"ENOUGH IS AS GOOD AS A FEAST"</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> crew of the "Jolly Susan" did little work
during the evening study hour; Judith, especially,
found that she could not keep her mind
on her tasks. This was the full flavour of
life at a boarding-school, surely, to break the
rules, and creep down the corridor in the
dark to eat forbidden food! She even let her
mind play round the food itself&mdash;chicken, meringues!
She could hardly wait for bedtime.</p>

<p>If Catherine had not been in the secret, she
would have been amazed at the swiftness with
which her family went to bed. Josephine was
usually incorrigibly slow, and Sally May always
needed reminding that the devotion bell
would ring in two minutes' time. To-night
clothes were neatly arranged ready for the
morning, rooms were in impeccable order, hair
was properly brushed, and there was no mad
rush to be at one's own door when the fatal
bell sounded.</p>

<p>At last "Lights out" bell rang and silence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
descended on South House. Ten o'clock,
and the prefects put out their lights, only the
tiny red fire-escape lamps shone dimly at intervals
down the corridor. Eleven o'clock, and
the night watchman had creaked by on his way
to East House. The way was clear.</p>

<p>Out of bed slipped the conspirators. Judith's
cheeks burned with excitement as, obedient to
orders, she put on her warmest kimono, and,
carrying mug and sofa pillow, followed Josephine
and Jane to the corridor.</p>

<p>Nancy and Sally May had already gone,
Josephine informed her in a piercing whisper,
and Nancy had said to be <i>very</i> careful of the
boards opposite Miss Marlowe's door because
they sometimes squeaked horribly.</p>

<p>Stealthily in Indian file they crept down the
corridor.</p>

<p>Horrors! The boards certainly did creak!
Miss Marlowe's light was still on! What if she
should open her door!</p>

<p>Judith, with her eyes glued on the crack of
light, clutched her kimono more tightly as if
to escape being seen, and in some inexplicable
way her mug slid from her cold fingers.</p>

<p>The fate of Sally May's party hung in the
balance for just so long as it takes a mug to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
fall to the ground, and Judith for a nightmare
second felt the bitterness of having betrayed
her friends to the enemy; but Jane, with a
magical dexterity, caught the mug "on the
fly" as Judith described it later, and for the
time being they were saved.</p>

<p>Judith's heart was still thumping from their
narrow escape when they joined the rest of the
party in the common room at the head of the
stairs. The blinds had been pulled up to let
in the pale moonlight, and in the semi-darkness
Judith could see five shadowy forms seated on
their pillows around the precious box.</p>

<p>"Are we all here?" said Sally May in a
sepulchral whisper.</p>

<p>"We are&mdash;thanks to Jane," said Judith,
and the episode of the mug was told to appreciative
listeners.</p>

<p>"Put on your flash, Nancy," commanded
Sally May; "no one is going to pass this door
and we'll never manage to carve the chicken
with this miserable knife unless we have more
light."</p>

<p>With infinite precautions the papers were
unwrapped, and mouths began to water as
certain favorite goodies appeared.</p>

<p>"Who's going to carve?" asked Sally May<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
surveying with a certain dismay a plump
brown bird and a seemingly inadequate pocketknife.</p>

<p>"Draw lots," suggested Rosamond.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Uggledy wuggledy doo,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rackety wackety boo,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Out goes you!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Here, Jane, you're it." And Jane lost no
time in attacking her job.</p>

<p>"My children! what <i>do</i> you think? Here's a
jelly or a mousse or something&mdash;it's all
creamy and quivery, anyway, and we haven't
any spoons!"</p>

<p>"I asked you&mdash;" began Jane reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know you did, but Mother never
mentioned a jelly and I thought spoons would
make a noise."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll have to have some," said Nancy
practically.</p>

<p>
"Uggledy wuggledy doo,"<br />
</p>

<p>Judith felt in her bones she was going to
be <i>it</i>. And she was.</p>

<p>"Let me go," said Nancy generously.</p>

<p>"No," said Judith, "Certainly <i>not</i>. Where'll
I get spoons?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just collect what you can," said Sally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
May, handing round rolls and sandwiches.
"I've got a shoe-horn and a medicine spoon,
and so has Jane. Watch out for Miss Marlowe."</p>

<p>Fear and the desire to partake of the "eats"
speeded Judith on her way, and she lost no
time in gathering up what utensils the "Jolly
Susan" could offer. Her thoughts flew to
Catherine for a moment as she passed her door
and she wished their beloved captain could be
with them. She little knew how nearly her
wish was fulfilled.</p>

<p>On the return journey as she hurried up
the corridor, having safely passed Miss Marlowe's
door, she suddenly heard a soft footfall
or the swish of a kimono, and then discovered
a dark form bearing down upon her. Could it
be Miss Marlowe? No, it wasn't tall enough.
It must be Miss Ashwell. Judith flattened
herself against the wall, which was fortunately
in the shadow, in the hope that she would not
be seen. But it was a very slender little hope,
and for the second time that evening Judith
was sure that their plans for a good time were
ruined, when, just as she had given herself up
for lost, the figure turned about and a voice,
unmistakably Miss Ashwell's, said, "Bother!
I've forgotten my sponge again."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Another disaster averted!</p>

<p>What a <i>gorgeous</i> time they had! What a
heavenly chicken!</p>

<p>What luscious meringues! And if you have
never in semi-darkness balanced a precious
morsel of jelly on the end of a nail-file, you
have missed one of thrills of <i>real</i> living.</p>

<p>"The spiffingest feed I ever had," declared
Judith as they began to pack up the remains
and remove all traces of their feast.</p>

<p>"Well, we haven't had all the thrills that
you've had to-night, Judibus, but for once
I've had a perfectly good meal," confessed
Rosamond, who was holding the useful little
flashlight, "and now I'm good and ready for
my perfectly good bed." She was voicing a
unanimous thought&mdash;they had had a jolly
time, but their feet had gone to sleep and their
eyes were beginning to feel drowsy&mdash;yes, certainly
bed would be good.</p>

<p>Pillows were sorted out, and Nancy with the
tiny light led the way. She tried to open the
door; it would not budge! She pulled hard.
Josephine pulled harder; Sally May tried; and
then consternation took possession of their
souls. Some one <i>had them</i>, had them with a
vengeance! Whatever would they do now?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Sally May was not in the least daunted,
whatever the others might feel. "I'll tell you,"
she said; "it's some one who wanted to come
to the party doing it for a joke"&mdash;but that
brought little comfort. The party was a
secret, and who would know where to find
them? Forebodings as to to-morrow's punishment
filled their minds.</p>

<p>Sally May, however, was accustomed to punishments.
"Sufficient unto the day" was
evidently her motto. "Come on, let's tell
ghost stories," she said, and the others obediently
seated themselves on the floor again.
Sally May produced a large box of chocolates
which they were keeping for another time, and
began a long tale of a ghost who followed, and
followed, and followed a man up and down, up
and down, the corridors of an old manor house.
The hero could hear the ghost's footsteps and
its blood-curdling laugh, but he was afraid to
turn his head, and when he did&mdash;very, very,
very, slowly&mdash;the muscles of seven little necks
stiffened obedient to Sally May's suggestion&mdash;he
saw a terrible&mdash;but here Rosamond broke in
with an hysterical cry, "Please, Sally May, I
can't bear any more"&mdash;and Sally May's spell
was broken.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>Indeed they all began to be frankly miserable,
for they were chilly by this time, and even
schoolgirls' stomachs are susceptible to unlimited
cake and candy. Nancy fell asleep and
leaned on Judith, making her most uncomfortable.
Sally May confessed quite openly to a
feeling of sickness, and in a steady whisper
poured into Judith's ear the ghastly details of
how ill she had been at Knowlton after a lobster
supper. The night wore on. Most of them
finally went to sleep in uncomfortable attitudes,
but about four o'clock in the morning,
Judith, who was much too unhappy and too
uncomfortable to sleep, got up stiffly from the
floor and walking about the room, tried the
door once more. To her huge astonishment
and joy it opened! Catherine had come up a
couple of hours before, but the striking of the
big clock in the hall had covered the very slight
noise of the turning of the lock.</p>

<p>"It was open all the time," protested several
unhappy voices.</p>

<p>"You didn't try it properly."</p>

<p>"We did," said other cross voices, and
sulkily and stiffly they creaked down the hall
to their longed-for beds.</p>

<p>The rising bell rang in about an hour's time;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
at least so it seemed to eight very sleepy girls.
Pancakes and maple syrup, the favourite York
Hill breakfast, brought them no solace; indeed,
to the surprise of their friends, they refused
them. Sally May, who demanded much sympathy,
reported to the nurse after breakfast.</p>

<p>"I don't feel well, Miss Anderson, I don't
really. I'm tired all over. I think if I had a
little rest&mdash;" she added plaintively.</p>

<p>"Put out your tongue," said Miss Anderson
cruelly. "Hm, blowing up for a bilious
attack. Oh, yes, you can go to morning lessons,
but report at the Infirmary this evening
for a dose of calomel."</p>

<p>Poor Sally May! The thought of the horrid
dose haunted her all day, and when evening
came her punishment was indeed complete.</p>

<p>Judith, Nancy, and Josephine had separately
and independently resolved by hook or by
crook to escape the hated morning walk or
"crocodile." A walk after their wakeful
night seemed simply impossible and the weather
was too bad for games. Many excuses were
thought of and rejected, but eventually they
presented themselves to the mistress-in-charge,
a certain zealous Miss Martin.</p>

<p>"Too tired to go out, Nancy? Very well,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
early bed, of course"&mdash;and she chalked up
Nancy's name with "Bed at eight-thirty."
Judith and Josephine were treated in like manner;
not that they minded very much, for bed
at eight-thirty had a soothing sound. But
Madam Retribution was not done with them
yet.</p>

<p>For a week or more they had been expecting
an invitation from Catherine to supper in
her room. It was a regular first-term institution
that a prefect should entertain her set of
cubicles, and rumours of other suppers had already
reached the ears of the crew of the
"Jolly Susan." Judith, especially, had been
looking forward to this treat. An evening in
Catherine's room, what a delight!</p>

<p>At evening prayers it was announced that
to-night's lecturer would not be able to come,
and promptly afterwards Catherine gave the
longed-for invitation. "Supper in my room
at eight-thirty," she whispered to each of the
five; "we'll have a jolly time." Her surprise
and astonishment at their stammered refusals
were great.</p>

<p>"Slacking the walk?" she said coldly. "Of
course, then, you can't have a treat"&mdash;and
she wasted no sympathy on them. Judith<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
could have wept with vexation and disappointment.</p>

<p>At half-past eight the crew of the "Jolly
Susan" crept sadly into bed and listened to the
laughter of the prefects gathered in Catherine's
room, devouring <i>their</i> supper. Sally
May had gone to the Infirmary, but one vow
was registered by the other chastened souls in
the "Jolly Susan"&mdash;"No more midnight
suppers!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>PUTTING IT THROUGH</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> last two weeks had been so full of other
things that lessons and their preparation had
taken a somewhat secondary place in the
thoughts of Form Five, and, in consequence,
they had merited and received many rebukes.</p>

<p>Sally May had spent two hours of a precious
Saturday afternoon learning poetry, for she
had failed miserably in the last literature test;
Josephine had been her companion in disgrace,
and had even had to spend a precious
Friday evening "in durance vile" because of
returned lessons.</p>

<p>Judith's pride had been badly hurt by Miss
Hilton's comment written in her geometry exercise
book, "Very poor work, indeed, untidy
and careless," and, worse still, when the lists
were posted for the mid-term Latin examination,
Judith's name had been halfway down
with fifty-six marks to her credit. At Miss
Graham's she had always headed the list. Just
for a moment she almost thought that there
must be some mistake, and then she realized<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
that Five A standards were high and first-class
standing meant first-class work.</p>

<p>Literature and history were Judith's strong
subjects, and on the morning when she saw
her Latin marks she made a mighty resolve to
head the list in at least one of these. It
wouldn't be easy. Joyce Hewson and Phyllis
Lovell had been steadily piling up marks all
term, and the whole form was watching their
tussle for first place. Christmas reports and
class standing for the half-year were made on
class work and on the examinations at the end
of the term.</p>

<p>"I've just <i>got</i> to have one 'first' on my report,"
said Judith to herself as she put away
her books after morning school. "I've just <i>got</i>
to&mdash;Daddy'll be awfully disappointed if I
don't." And then, taking her place in the line
that was filing into Big Hall, she whispered
to Nancy, "What're we going to have this
morning?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure," said Nancy, "but I think
Ruth Laughton's going to speak. I saw her
going into Miss Meredith's study this morning."</p>

<p>The last period of Friday morning school
belonged to Miss Meredith.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's like a grab-bag," Nancy had inelegantly
told Judith; "you never know what
you are going to get&mdash;sometimes it is a lecture,
sometimes Miss Meredith reads us a story,
sometimes we have carol singing&mdash;I do like
that&mdash;and during the War we had talks from
people who had been there. Once we had a
Polish Countess who spoke the funniest English,
but she was awfully brave, and once a
man from Serbia. He was in the Red Cross
and he told us a terrible story about the state
of the Serbian children. We held form meetings
the Monday following and voted to give
up candy for a whole term, all of us, and we
sent the money to him for the relief work. I
think it's the nicest time of the week."</p>

<p>Judith too was coming to look forward to
that last hour of the school week, very often
to schoolgirls a wasted hour at the fag end
of things.</p>

<p>This Friday an Old Girl was to speak to
them. Miss Meredith held that a school like
York Hill, in order to justify the time and
effort, the money and brains, the service and
consecration put into it, should send out girls
who would be leaders and workers in everything
which would make for the betterment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
of the community in which they lived, and
unconsciously the Nancys and Judiths of the
School, through these Friday morning glimpses
of the great world of service, would be steadily
and surely prepared for the part which they
were to play. Social service, as such, was not
talked about; most girls dislike what they
call "preachments," but when Form Four decided
to make baby clothes as a Christmas
shower for the cr&ecirc;che where an Old Girl
worked, and when Form Five promised a
woolen sweater from every girl for the Fourteen
Club at the University Settlement, social
service became a real and vital fact in their
lives. For, as Judith learned, knitted sweaters
mean work, and wool costs money, which had
to be deducted from an already painfully
shrunken allowance, and baby clothes, although
fascinating and cute, represent many hours of
careful stitching.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the seeds planted on Friday
mornings grew and flourished until "Noblesse
oblige" became a natural and an actual attitude
towards life. Social service of some sort
or other, after one left school, was an established
fact like unlimited tea-parties and dancing
partners. And Miss Meredith and many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
of her staff made it the business of their lives
to see that it should be social service of the right
kind.</p>

<p>About once a term the Old Girls' Association
provided a speaker. Miss Meredith had
entertained many distinguished guests who
had spoken in Big Hall, but none were made
more welcome than the Old Girls, for the Head
Mistress knew the appeal which they alone
could, and did make. To-day the speaker was
to be Ruth Laughton, a nursing sister decorated
for gallantry by the King. Catherine
had been a Junior when Ruth was Captain of
South House, and she had pointed out to
Judith Ruth's name on the tablet in Big Hall
where the names of House and School captains
were printed in letters of gold.</p>

<p>Judith considered, as Form Five marched
into the Hall, what it would be like to carry
out wounded soldiers under fire. Nursing Sister
Laughton must be big and strong and
brave, perhaps she was always brave and did
not really mind the explosions. What was
courage, anyway? And then, before she
could decide this puzzling question, Miss
Meredith was coming down the centre aisle
with her distinguished guest. The School gave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
a thunderous welcome and settled back after
Miss Meredith's brief introduction to hear a
thrilling story.</p>

<p>Form Five confessed among themselves
afterwards to a distinct feeling of disappointment
when the speaker came forward. She
was small, "not a bit pretty," the girls decided,
and her voice seemed tired and lacking in vitality.
The decoration on her breast appeared
to be the only significant thing about her. Evidently
Ruth was nervous.</p>

<p>"If she is not afraid of bombs, she is afraid
of us," thought Judith, for the Sister's face
grew white, her lips dry, and her assertion
that she was glad to be back at dear old York
Hill seemed to be all that she could remember
of her speech. Three hundred pairs of hands
had clapped her a warm welcome, but now
she confronted three hundred pairs of critical
eyes. She faltered, began again, and finally
looked appealingly, a schoolgirl once more, at
her Head Mistress.</p>

<p>"Never mind about your own experiences
just now, Ruth," said Miss Meredith's calm,
reassuring voice, "we'd like to hear a little
more about the children's hostels in the north
of France. We are all interested because we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
are sending clothes to Jean Warner to distribute."</p>

<p>And then a miracle happened, the whole
School saw it. Ruth was transformed before
them, her eyes brightened, her shoulders
straightened, her voice had an inspiring ring
in it as she told the story of the heroism of
other Old Girls.</p>

<p>She had an interesting story to tell and she
told it well: even the First-Form wrigglers sat
with their eyes glued on her face as she told of
the brave fight which was being made for the
life and health of the children of Europe.
"There is one thing especially I should like
to tell you," she finished, looking down into the
sea of upturned faces, "wherever I found a
York girl&mdash;and you know my duties have
taken me into all sorts of queer places these last
four years&mdash;whether she was a V.A.D. ambulance
driver, a nurse in hospital, a Y.W.C.A.
secretary, or a Child's Welfare worker, always
the record was the same, that when a York Hill
girl undertook something, she <i>put it through</i>&mdash;especially
if it were a hard job! That's
what the General said when he pinned on
Gwen's Mons Star&mdash;'Another of the ladies
from Canada! They have taught you out there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
to put things through with a will!' York Hill
Old Girls look to York Hill present girls to
maintain the record of the School."</p>

<p>And if the applause meant anything, it
surely stood for a determination on the part
of her listeners to maintain the York Hill
tradition.</p>

<p>Without considering the matter overmuch,
Judith was convinced that the thing she was
"to put through" during these last few weeks
of term was hard study, and she bent to her
tasks with a will.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"But the best laid schemes of mice and men<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Gang aft agley."</span><br />
</div>

<p>The School seemed suddenly to become very
busy, though about what Judith did not know.
Much whispering was heard in the "Jolly
Susan"; Nancy and Josephine looked very
mysterious, girls from all parts of the School
seemed to be in the same secret, and Judith
heard tantalizing phrases, "scenery committee"&mdash;"scene
shifters"&mdash;"costume committee"&mdash;"the
Play." Very soon she herself was
in a big secret, for a meeting of all New Girls
was called by the School Captain, and Eleanor
explained that the New Girls would be entertained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
at a play in the last week of November;
that the custom was that the New Girls should
return the compliment by an entertainment
given during the last week of term; that since
the New Girls were decidedly in the minority,
two of the prefects and she herself would help
in any way they could; and that, in a word, she
was now ready to receive nominations for the
various committees.</p>

<p>An exciting hour followed. To her dismay
Judith found herself on the Costume Committee
and she hated sewing. Sally May gave her
little comfort&mdash;"just be glad you don't have
to paint scenery; that's a dirty and hard job
if you like," said Sally May. "Miss Ashwell
makes us work like demons. If she didn't
work like a demon herself, we just wouldn't
do it," was her sage comment. Committee
meetings multiplied. The play chosen was to
be kept a secret from its audience and a delicious
air of mystery pervaded the whole
School.</p>

<p>After much discussion and help from Eleanor
and Miss Marlowe, the New Girls chose the
"Christmas Carol." Many other things were
suggested, but Scrooge and Tiny Tim had
apparently a warm place in their affections,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and the appropriateness of the Christmas
story for the end of term was irresistible.</p>

<p>The choosing of the cast was a difficult and
a tedious job, and Miss Marlowe and Eleanor
spent much time trying out various candidates,
but at last the list was complete, and, a little
to her relief, and, it must be confessed, a little
to her regret, Judith was not included. She
had never acted, and she had a firm conviction
that she could not, so that the regret was
merely that she didn't like to think that other
people had the same conviction.</p>

<p>Her membership on the Costume Committee
was no sinecure. Coveted Saturday afternoon
and evening leisure had to be given up
to the stitching of long seams. Mathilde LeBrun,
who was another Josephine in that her
brain seemed to be in her fingers, was convener
of the committee, and under her direction
Judith sewed and cut out, and, it must be
confessed, ripped. Tiny Tim's coat and trousers
were her task, and although the smallest
of the new girls, Edith Holland by name, had
been chosen for this r&ocirc;le, Judith found the
utmost difficulty in making her look like
a Tiny Tim. Twice did she make and un-make
that wretched little suit, but she was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
nothing if not conscientious, and at last it
was finished.</p>

<p>"Twelfth Night," which was the Old Girls'
play, was a huge success. Nancy and Josephine
had been so excited all week that Judith
had found it about impossible to keep her own
attention on her lessons. Catherine must be
a chief character in the play, decided Judith,
for Catherine's room was the centre of numberless
committee meetings and endless discussions,
and Genevieve Singleton&mdash;who, to
Judith's envy had established herself as Catherine's
chief messenger&mdash;ran hither and
thither, bursting with importance. Nevertheless
the secret was kept, and as Judith sat with
Sally May and Frances Purdy and all the
other new girls on Friday night and listened
to the noise behind the green curtain, she felt
that she could bear the suspense no longer.</p>

<p>And then, when the curtain rose, the Master
Magician waved his wand and Judith, who
had seen very few plays, was transported to a
land of beauty, romance, and sweet adventure.
Helen made a noble Duke, and Catherine an
enchanting Viola. Judith had never quite recaptured
the thrill of delight she had felt when
on the opening night of term she had first seen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Catherine, but now to the charm and witchery
of first impressions of beauty was added the
knowledge of Catherine's sweetness and gentleness.
Nancy might be a witty Maria, and
Josephine a rollicking Sir Toby; Judith had
eyes and ears for Viola only, and as the play
progressed she envied passionately the Duke
who seemed criminally stupid in his misunderstanding
of Viola's love. The surprise of the
play was Genevieve Singleton's Malvolio.
Even Judith was moved out of her trance of
adoration to laughter and admiration.</p>

<p>"That was real acting," said Sally May
with the air of a theatre habitu&eacute; as Malvolio
pranced off the stage in the immortal scene of
the yellow stockings and cross-garters.</p>

<p>After the last bravos had died away and the
actors had bowed their thanks before the footlights,
both audience and players were refreshed
with lemonade and cakes, and Judith
transferred her envy to the fortunate ones who
stood talking over the evening's triumph with
Catherine and Genevieve and the rest of the
cast. She envied Genevieve who had had such
a success, and she wished, but did not dare, to
join the group. "Perhaps," thought silly
Judith, "if I run upstairs now and get her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
room ready for her, Catherine may kiss me
good-night." Judith was on the verge of what
is technically known as a "crush."</p>

<p>Meanwhile preparations went forward in
earnest for the "Christmas Carol," and "All
costumes must be finished for Monday. Full
rehearsal at eight o'clock in the Big Hall." So
ran the Order-in-Council.</p>

<p>"I'm certainly glad Tiny Tim's costume is
done," thought Judith as she ran downstairs for
the rehearsal; "four more days till the literature
exam. I'm going to work like everything."</p>

<p>"Come on, Judy," Sally May hailed her as
she found her place behind the curtain where
she was to help shift scenery; "you're late, but
who ever heard of a rehearsal starting on time?"</p>

<p>"Seems to be some sort of a row on," said
Judith as a distinct groan reached their ears.
"What's up?" she asked as they joined the
group on the stage.</p>

<p>"Marjorie Jones has measles," answered
Eleanor, their stage manager: "come here,
all of you, and think <i>hard</i>. Who can take
Scrooge at such short notice? Is there any new
girl with a good memory? It's the longest
part by far."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Various names were proposed and rejected
for one reason or another, and then Eleanor's
eye fell on Judith, who saw her consider for a
moment, speak in a low tone to the two other
prefects; then very reluctantly she answered
the summons, "Judith, come here and read
this page for me, will you, please? Perhaps
you'll do."</p>

<p>Judith read the page and a tiny feeling of resentment
began to make itself felt. She hadn't
been asked to do anything nice, or anything
she wanted, and now they weren't even asking
her if she would be willing to take Marjorie's
place.</p>

<p>"I guess you'll do," was Eleanor's uncomplimentary
comment when Judith had finished.</p>

<p>"There's really no one else," she said, turning
to Patricia, "and I think Judy can be word-perfect
by Friday. I'll coach her every spare
minute myself. Come along, Judy," she added,
"and read over the part before we begin."</p>

<p>Somewhat breathless from this prompt decision,
Judith obediently took the manuscript
and seated herself at one corner of the stage.
Suddenly as she read, the full meaning of this
new turn of events flashed into her brain. The
final term examination in literature was listed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
for Friday morning, and Judith had planned
to spend all her spare time between now and
then in the thorough revision of her work, for
there was still much to be done, and this examination
would really decide whether she or
Joyce or Phyllis would head the list.</p>

<p>For a long ten minutes Judith read her part
and at the same time debated within herself,
while Eleanor settled some difference of opinion
about exits and entrances. Self number
one tried to hoodwink self number two&mdash;"Top
Self" and "Deep-Down Self," Judith as a
little girl had christened these two voices within
her. "Daddy would like you to come out
first; you oughtn't to disappoint him. Lessons
must be done. Just go and tell Eleanor
you can't do it and then your time will be your
own."</p>

<p>"No," said Deep-Down Self, "be fair, Judy.
You know you can't act well, you won't be a
success like Genevieve. You don't want Catherine
and the others to see you fail, and
honestly, do you want to come out first for
Daddy's sake or for your own? I really believe
you don't think enough fuss has been
made over you. You'd <i>rather</i> work at your
literature and come first, perhaps, but you can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
memorize quickly and they need you. Which
<i>ought</i> you to do?&mdash;never mind whether it's
hard or not."</p>

<p>Judith had always been honest with herself
and she knew quite well what the real issue was.</p>

<p>The struggle was hard, the hardest, perhaps,
which Judith had ever fought. Mechanically
she turned the pages while the argument continued
within her. She seemed to have no way
of deciding, when suddenly she remembered
Nursing Sister Ruth's words, "York Hill girls
have the reputation overseas of being willing
to tackle any job&mdash;no matter how hard&mdash;and
of <i>putting it through</i>." Top Self hadn't a
chance after that. Filling in here seemed her
most immediate duty and Judith settled down
grimly to her task.</p>

<p>The rehearsal was long and tiring, and
twenty times during the first hour Judith was
tempted to give up. But she did her best, and
although Eleanor was distracted by all the
numberless things demanding attention, she
found time to stop and say at the end of the
first act, "Good work, Judy! I knew I could
depend on you. You'll make a first-rate
Scrooge, and you are a brick to get to work
without any fuss." And although Judith did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
not believe the remark about her acting, her
face flushed with pleasure and she determined
that she would not spend another moment in
questioning. This job must be put through.</p>

<p>And it was. She woke early in the morning
and learned her part by the light of Nancy's
flashlight. She cut her recreation time and
scamped her lesson preparation. She thought
and lived Scrooge, and as she had a good memory
she was word-perfect before Eleanor had
thought it possible. Eleanor and Patricia
coached her whenever they could, and Miss
Marlowe gave her Wednesday evening and
Thursday afternoon.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Friday morning, and with it the literature
examination! Judith read the paper with a
sinking heart. She would not fail, but, as she
had guessed, the extra reading which she had
planned to do during these last few days would
have given her paper "The little more, and
how much it is" which would have lifted it to
the first rank. Came Friday afternoon with
its last rehearsal and then the fateful night.</p>

<p>Judith will never forget the thrill of terror
that ran through her as the curtain rose and she
saw the rows of faces staring at her out of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
semi-darkness. For an instant she was paralyzed
with terror, and it was only the audience's
delight at finding Frances arrayed as
Scrooge's irrepressible nephew that covered
the gap between "Merry Christmas, Uncle,"
and "Bah! Humbug!"</p>

<p>The first short scene was wooden enough
in all conscience, but Judith remembered her
words, and as the story progressed she got a
better grip on herself surprising and delighting
Eleanor and those who were in the secret
by her spirited acting.</p>

<p>But at the end of Act Three, Nancy, who
had slipped behind the scenes to congratulate
her chum, and to tell her that her wig was the
least bit askew, was surprised and alarmed to
find Judith almost in tears.</p>

<p>"I can't do the last act, Nancy, I simply
can't. My face feels all stiff and solemn. I
can't laugh and joke, I can't, no matter how I
try"&mdash;and two tears actually rolled down her
cheeks. She was tired out, and the very imagination
which had made it possible for her to
be for the moment the gloomy old miser, now
made it seem impossible for her to change him
in a few minutes into a jolly, generous, incarnation
of old Father Christmas.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>Nancy was horrified and distracted. She
did her best, but with seemingly no avail, and
then she had one of those inspirations, which
seem almost heaven-sent. Hurrying back and
learning that there were still four or five
minutes before the curtain would rise, she
sought Catherine, who luckily had left her
seat during the interlude.</p>

<p>"Captain," she said, saluting, "there is one
of the crew who needs your help; can you come
at once?"</p>

<p>And then, as they neared the stage&mdash;</p>

<p>"It's Judy, Cathy," she whispered; "do
buck her up. She has been such a brick, but
she is so tired that she feels that she can't do
the last act."</p>

<p>Catherine waited for no more explanations,
but went swiftly behind the curtain, where she
found Judith trying to look cheerful, but making
a dismal failure of it. "Careful," said
Cathy to herself. "I mustn't be sympathetic
or she will break down."</p>

<p>Judith looked up, and instead of the dreaded
warning that the curtain was going up, here
was Catherine saluting her merrily.</p>

<p>"Good work, Judy! The 'Jolly Susan'
needs a first mate; can I induce you to accept<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the job?" And she put a steadying arm round
the new mate's shoulders. "You've been
splendid; we're all proud of you, and especially
we of the 'Jolly Susan.'"</p>

<p>No more question of can or can't. Judith
felt that she could do anything for her captain
and here was a chance. She threw herself
into the unforgettable scene of Scrooge's awakening,
and the whole school was infected with
the joyousness of her declaration: "I am as
light as a feather. I am as happy as an angel. I
am as merry as a schoolboy. A Merry Christmas
to everybody, a Happy New Year to all
the world. Hullo, here, whoop! Hullo."</p>

<p>And every one was quite ready to agree
with Scrooge's declaration at the end of the
scene, "Wonderful party, wonderful games,
wonderful unanimity, won-der-ful happiness!"</p>

<p>The New Girls were cheered to the echo by
the School, and the party which was voted a
great success ended with cake and lemonade
and a delightful Sir Roger de Coverly in which
every one took part.</p>

<p>Judith, dancing with Bob Cratchit, felt supremely
happy, and her cup was filled to overflowing
by Miss Meredith's words as she said
good-night.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Congratulations on your success, Judith,
you gave us a fine presentation of Scrooge,
and Eleanor tells me you had very little time
for preparation."</p>

<p>And then the delightful whispered conferences
upstairs after "Lights Out" bell had
rung&mdash;Catherine turned a deaf ear, for discipline
must occasionally be relaxed.</p>

<p>"Did you see Mr. Fezziwig's coat, Judy?"</p>

<p>"Wasn't Mrs. Cratchit too funny for
words?"</p>

<p>"Wasn't the ghost splendid?"</p>

<p>"I shivered all over when he was speaking,"
Nancy declared; and so on and so on, until
Judith fell asleep and dreamed that she was
dancing the Sir Roger with Miss Meredith
arrayed as Mrs. Cratchit, and that, so arrayed,
Miss Meredith had proceeded to the platform
and had read out the term's marks beginning
with Five A. First, Judith Benson; second,
Joyce Hewson; third, Nancy Nairn.</p>

<p>It was a good thing that Judith had the fun
of her dream because in the lists read out after
prayers next morning our heroine stood fourth,
in Five A, but that didn't spoil her morning,
such a happy morning. Desks were tidied,
Christmas presents tied up, suitcases packed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
and at twelve o'clock a short Christmas service
was held in Big Hall.</p>

<p>The carols which they had been learning
the last few weeks at morning prayers were
sung now with a right good will to the accompaniment
of the School orchestra. And then
Miss Meredith, having read the beautiful
Christmas story, explained the meaning of its
message so clearly, so simply, and yet so earnestly,
and with such a passionate longing
that from York Hill there should indeed radiate
"Peace and good will towards all men,"
that not the stupidest nor the most frivolous
girl but was touched to a sense of higher ideals
and nobler living.</p>

<p>Every girl in the School knew that the
Head Mistress was humbly striving to embody
in her own life the high ideals she held before
her pupils, and because of this they listened.
Doubtless some of the seed fell by the wayside,
some into hard and stony ground, some was
choked by the deceit and riches of this world,
but other seed fell into good ground and
brought forth abundantly, "some thirty, some
sixty, and some an hundred-fold."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Christmas holidays brought a much-needed
rest.</p>

<p>"No parties these holidays," said Aunt Nell
firmly, as she ushered Judith into a pretty sunshiny
room; "bed at nine o'clock, breakfast
at nine o'clock, and any amount of skating
and tobogganing in between. I promised
your mother that you should have a very quiet
time."</p>

<p>But a very quiet time was not just the holiday
that Judith had planned to have, and after
a long night's sleep and a peaceful day devoted
to letter-writing she was lively as a
cricket and ready for anything.</p>

<p>Christmas shopping absorbed the first two
days: Aunt Nell found it tiring, but to Judith
the shops all glittering with Yuletide gaiety
were wholly fascinating. There were toys to be
bought for six-year-old Doris and little Bobbie
and Baby Hugh, and something very nice
for Nancy. Nothing seemed good enough for
Nancy, but at last she found a little string<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
of white coral faintly touched with rose which
she was certain would look "just perfectly
lovely" with Nancy's roseleaf complexion,
and, after much anxious calculating as to what
money would be left for pocket money during
the holidays, the corals were finally bought
and sent off to Quebec.</p>

<p>Up to the day before Christmas the weather
had been very uncertain, and Judith, who had
bought Bobbie a new sled was afraid that she
would have to pull him on bare sidewalks, and
that the stories of Santa Claus and his reindeer
would fall rather flat if there were no snow
on the ground to add a touch of reality to
the tale.</p>

<p>But on Christmas Eve to every one's joy the
snow fell softly but steadily all day, and next
morning the sky was so blue, the sun so bright,
and the ground so dazzling white in its snowy
covering, that Judith running out to the verandah
fairly danced with joy.</p>

<p>"Do come out and see!" she cried to Aunt
Nell; "it's exactly like a Christmas-card
Christmas if only a little English robin would
hop into the picture."</p>

<p>Stockings had already been emptied and
their contents exclaimed over, and no wonder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Judith was happy. Perhaps Santa Claus
had an especially soft corner in his heart for
schoolgirls whose mothers were far away at
Christmas-time. Judith had never had such
enchanting presents&mdash;a string of beautiful
amber beads from Daddy; the daintiest of
shell-pink cr&ecirc;pe kimonos with satin slippers
and cap to match from mother; a pretty camisole
from Nancy; a woolen skating-set of
palest primrose from Uncle Tom; and&mdash;joy
of joys! a new white and silver evening frock
from Aunt Nell.</p>

<p>Judith promised to take Bobbie for a sleigh-ride,
but ran upstairs to have another peep at
the new frock first, and Aunt Nell found her
gloating over it.</p>

<p>"I know," she said, smiling at Judith's raptures;
"I've been there myself. I'm sure
your mother thought two frocks ample for a
sixteen-year-old, and I expect you have worn
them so often already that you never want
to see them again. Hannah shall help you
freshen them up with a new flower or a bit of
gauze, and I hope you will have jolly times
in the new one."</p>

<p>Judith folded away the delicious bit of finery
in its tissue wrappings, and then, standing at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
her dressing-table and looking dreamily and
happily into the mirror, she made a picture of
herself dancing in her silver frock with Catherine,
admired by Nancy and Josephine, and
envied by all the girls of South House, and she
privately resolved at once to save enough out
of her allowance for silver shoes.</p>

<p>"Hurry, hurry!" shouted Uncle Tom, and
hastily donning her new skating outfit Judith
joined the group in the hall.</p>

<p>They had glorious fun in the snow. Doris
and Bobbie, rolled up in furs so that they
looked like little 'possums, had turns riding in
the new sled to the park, and then the whole
family were packed into the big toboggan and
Uncle Tom had more fun even than Bobbie.
Oh, it was good to be alive!</p>

<p>Next morning brought a welcome letter from
Sally May who was spending the holidays with
Nancy in Quebec. Judith had just been thinking
about them and wishing she could compare
notes about Christmas presents, and have a
really good gossip.</p>

<p>"Quebec is the most enchanting place,"
wrote Sally May; "you know how I've hated
learning Canadian and British history&mdash;well,
here the history is <i>real</i>&mdash;Nancy's father is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
awfully keen about the monuments and things
and I'm getting to be keen myself. Jack has
a couple of R. M. C. boys here for the holidays,
and then there's His Lordship Brother Tim&mdash;Mrs.
Nairn is a dear and is giving us an awfully
good time. If only you were here, Judy,
it would be perfect."</p>

<p>If only she were! Judith sighed and wished
<i>she</i> had two big brothers&mdash;or at least that
Nancy had included her in the invitation. She
was right in her surmise that Sally May had
been chosen because she was so far from home,
but she couldn't help wishing&mdash;</p>

<p>Judith had heard Aunt Nell talking to a
gentleman in the drawing-room across the hall,
and now, to her surprise, Aunt Nell left him
and came into the library looking somewhat
puzzled.</p>

<p>"Mr. Nairn, Nancy's father, is here, Judith.
I find that Mrs. Nairn and I are old friends.
I hadn't guessed that your Nancy's mother
was the Elizabeth Dalton I knew years ago.
She has sent a very kind invitation for you to
spend the New Year's week-end with them.
Mr. Nairn is going to Quebec by to-night's
train, and could take you with him and bring
you back on Tuesday. I don't know whether<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
I ought"&mdash;but at the sight of the ecstatic joy
on Judith's face she did not finish her sentence.
"Run along, dear, and pack the new frock.
I don't need to ask you if you want to go. You
have been a good child and I think you have
had enough rest. Come first and be introduced
to Mr. Nairn. It <i>is</i> kind of him to take you."</p>

<p>A radiant Judith packed a club bag and
suitcase. Could Uncle Tom and Mother have
guessed that such a fairy-tale was going to
happen when they planned their gifts?&mdash;But,
of course not. Where were her skates and
plenty of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'handerchiefs'">handkerchiefs</ins>? Silver shoes she must
have sometime, but here were the old white
ones in the meantime.</p>

<p>Nancy and Sally May were in the limousine
waiting for the travellers at the station next
day, and as Judith caught sight of them she
realized with a joyous leap of her heart how
homesick she had been for the sound of Sally
May's pretty voice and the sight of Nancy's
dear, merry face.</p>

<p>Ever so many things had happened, and
better still were going to happen. Sally May
had had her hair bobbed, and very <i>chic</i> it looked
curling under the rim of her little fur hat.
Nancy had a thrilling tale of Christmas presents<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
to tell, and they had not reached the end
of the Christmas happenings when the car
drew up before a comfortable-looking, rather
old-fashioned house surrounded by what was
evidently a big garden under a thick mantle
of snow.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nairn's welcome made Judith feel at
home at once, and she gave her aunt's messages
to her hostess so prettily and so modestly that
Mrs. Nairn was quite charmed with Nancy's
new friend.</p>

<p>At dinner the sons of the house appeared,
and with them Tom Southam, Jack's roommate
at college. Jack had the same merry
blue eyes and sunny smile as his sister, and
Judith forgot to be shy with him. Thomas was
a cheery youth, whose chief interest at the dinner-table
was the food, and Judith gave him
scant attention. But Tim, the elder brother,
who had been in the Flying Corps and had
several enemy machines to his credit, who still
limped from injuries received during an air-fight,
and whose grey eyes had the keen, piercing,
and yet dreamy look of the genuine
bird-man, was sufficiently a hero to prove undeniably
attractive. Tim was courteous and
kind, but from the height of his five-and-twenty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
years a trifle condescending, and indeed
he was wishing within himself that "Mum
wouldn't fill the house with such kids."</p>

<p>The boys had planned to go skiing next day
and after some private suggestions from Mrs.
Nairn, they asked the girls to come and watch
the fun. Neither Sally May nor Judith had
ever been on skis, but here was a splendid
chance to try.</p>

<p>"Drive us over to the Ramparts, Tim,
please," said Nancy as they started off. "I
don't want Judith to be in Quebec another hour
without seeing our view."</p>

<p>"Right you are," answered Tim, "we'd better
go while it's clear&mdash;though, of course, the
only way to see Quebec is from the river."</p>

<p>"I always get thrills," said Nancy, "when
I come down the river and see the big rock and
the town. Think of being Jacques Cartier&mdash;the
first to see it. For a while, you know, I
used to put at the top of my letters, 'Quebec&mdash;the
Rock Fortress of New France.'"</p>

<p>"Cheek, that's what," said Jack; "I hope
you apologize to Wolfe when you do it&mdash;there,
by the way, is the Wolfe-Montcalm Monument&mdash;see,
shining over the tops of the trees&mdash;I
bet you can't recite the inscription, Nan,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
for Judith, who ought to improve her mind."</p>

<p>"Lost your bet," returned Nancy promptly&mdash;"a
pound box, if you please&mdash;no, half a
pound will do, for I can't say it in Latin, but I
certainly can in English.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Valour Gave Them a Common Death,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">History a Common Fame,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Posterity a Common Monument.'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Bravo&mdash;I'll make it a pound&mdash;but of
course you looked it up to show off to Sally
May."</p>

<p>"Well, I did look it up," confessed Nancy,
"but Father promised to take us to see the
sights as soon as Judy came and he would have
disowned me if I didn't know that much."</p>

<p>They had reached the Ramparts and Judith
caught her breath in amazement at the wonderful
scene. Away below them flowed the majestic
St. Lawrence, its snow-clad banks pierced here
and there by tiny villages each with its heavenward-pointing
spire; to the north were the
Laurentian Hills, now glistening in a dazzling
white mantle; at their feet was the town, quaint
and picturesque, its spires and monuments reminders
of its romantic past.</p>

<p>"There's the Ursuline convent, Judy," said
Sally May, eagerly pointing out the group of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
buildings. "Mr. Nairn told me the most interesting
thing about it&mdash;there's a lamp there
that was lighted over two hundred years ago
by a girl, Marie de Repentigny&mdash;just imagine
all the things that have happened since that
flame was lit."</p>

<p>"En avant&mdash;forward march," said Jack;
"this is not Mr. Nairn's personally conducted
tour&mdash;we, I might observe parenthetically, intend
to ski this afternoon."</p>

<p>They bundled into the motor once more and
were soon on the slopes a little lower down
where several flying figures could already be
seen. It was an ideal place for the thrilling
sport&mdash;for there were a number of high places
where experts could take high jumps, and
lower slopes in plenty for the learners and the
more timid, and great snowy fields beyond
where the whiteness was broken by the gay-coloured
caps and scarves of tobogganers and
skaters.</p>

<p>Tom took Nancy down to one of the ponds
to skate, while Tim and Jack gave Judith and
Sally May their first lesson.</p>

<p>Tim proved a splendid teacher and Judith
made such progress in the management of the
long clumsy skis that at the end of an hour the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
boys left Nancy in charge of their pupils, and
went off to try some of the higher jumps.</p>

<p>Judith found that she couldn't do as well
without Tim's precept and example, and
neither she nor Sally May was sorry when
Nancy declared they could have just one more
jump&mdash;they had no idea how stiff they would
be to-morrow.</p>

<p>Judith stood for a moment enjoying the
scene. The sky was still blue, but there were
bands of colour in the west and the shadows of
the pine trees had lengthened considerably. She
drew a deep breath of unconscious enjoyment
drinking in the wonderful air that tasted like
clear spring water, and then, making sure that
both skis were quite straight, she pushed off.</p>

<p>For a moment like a bird she felt herself flying
through the air. How glorious! Then quite
suddenly came a sense of suffocation and thick
darkness. In some way the long curved wings
on her feet had tripped her and she had pitched
head foremost into a deep snow-bank. Nancy,
who saw her disappear, halloed to the boys as
she sped to the place where Judith was buried,
and they appeared with magical swiftness.</p>

<p>They pulled Judith out&mdash;not without difficulty&mdash;and
wiped the snow off her face.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you hurt?" said Jack anxiously.</p>

<p>Judith struggled to get her breath.</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;too&mdash;beautiful," she said, without
opening her eyes, her mind evidently still on
the river view,&mdash;"perfectly glorious!"</p>

<p>Jack burst into relieved laughter.</p>

<p>"Judith's a game little thing," he said to his
mother later on; "I suppose we shouldn't have
left them so soon, but she seemed to get the
hang of it very quickly&mdash;she slid into that
bank as neatly as an arrow&mdash;I'm mighty glad
she isn't hurt."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Judith could hardly keep her eyes open at the
dinner-table, and she was glad enough to accept
Mrs. Nairn's suggestion that she go to bed
early.</p>

<p>Nancy and Sally May perched on the foot
of the bed ready to talk over the day's happenings,
but found to their astonishment that
Judy seemed asleep almost as soon as her head
touched the pillow. They tiptoed gently away,
but they need not have been afraid of wakening
her.</p>

<p>"Doesn't she look sweet?" whispered loyal
Nancy to Sally May as she turned off the
bedside lamp. Judith was smiling happily,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
for in her dreams she was flying, flying through
sunlit skies, and Tim, of the grey eyes and
the half friendly, half quizzical smile, was flying
beside her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>CASTLES IN THE AIR</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> morning Judith could scarcely move;
her limbs were stiff from the unaccustomed
exercise and one shoulder was bruised and
wrenched from her fall, so Mrs. Nairn kept
her in bed all morning and gave her much
petting and mothering.</p>

<p>The plans for the afternoon had included
a skating party on the river, ending with a
drive out to the Nairns' summer cottage, which
had been opened in preparation for this week
of winter sports. A neighbouring farmer's
wife had promised to have a roaring fire ready
for the skaters when they should appear about
five o'clock, and the farmer himself was to
meet them at the river with his big sleigh.
Clearly Judith could not skate to-day, so other
plans were made for her. Nancy, of course,
must be with the skaters, since she was the
hostess, but Sally May insisted on staying at
home with Judith. Naturally this embarrassed
Judith, for she knew that Sally May loved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
skating, and an outdoor party of this kind
would be a novelty to a Southerner. Finally
Jack talked things over with his mother, and,
as Judith declared that she was well enough
to go, Mrs. Nairn agreed that she should drive
with Jack to the cottage and he would leave
her there with Mme. Berthier, while he rejoined
the skaters on the river.</p>

<p>Tim, to Judith's disappointment, declared
that he had an engagement and couldn't come.</p>

<p>"I can't think what's happening to Tim,"
grumbled Nancy as they changed into warm
clothes for their long drive; "usually he's a
dear about helping to entertain, but he's
not a bit like himself, he looks so glum and
'grouchy.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, Nancy!" Judith protested, "I don't
see how you can say such a thing! I think he
looks just lovely!"</p>

<p>"Just lovely," Nancy laughed wickedly;
"he'll be pleased when I tell him."</p>

<p>Poor Judith crimsoned.</p>

<p>"Oh, Nancy," she begged, "you wouldn't,
surely you wouldn't. I just meant that he
had nice eyes."</p>

<p>But Nancy would make no promises.</p>

<p>Promptly after an early lunch the skaters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
set off, and Jack appeared with a horse and
a little old-fashioned cutter which he had borrowed
from an uncle who scorned motors and
still clung to his horse. Judith was tucked
up in a fur robe in the cutter and off they went.</p>

<span class="caption">JUDITH WAS TUCKED UP IN A FUR ROBE IN THE CUTTER AND OFF THEY WENT</span>
</div>

<p>"It's almost as good as skiing or flying,"
laughed Judith as the light sleigh flew over
the snow and the bells on the horse jingled
a merry accompaniment to their talk. It was
another day of magical colouring&mdash;all blue
and gold and dazzling white, and "Little
Oaks" was reached all too soon in Judith's
opinion. To their dismay there was no friendly
column of smoke announcing the fire that
Mme. Berthier had promised.</p>

<p>"It's a good thing the Berthiers are only
a mile away," said Jack; "whatever can have
happened?"</p>

<p>He came out of the little whitewashed cottage
with a grave face. "Jacques is away at
the lumber camp and Toinette and the two
younger children are down with flu&mdash;Toinette
seems very ill; luckily Jeanne is old enough to
do the nursing, but they need a doctor, and I'm
afraid I'll have to go off at once. Nancy will
be disappointed, but it can't be helped. We'll
pin a note on the door for her as we go back&mdash;it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
would take too long to open the house
and get a good fire going&mdash;and a wood fire
wouldn't keep in all afternoon anyway&mdash;and
I couldn't leave you alone&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, please, please," begged Judith, "do
let me stay&mdash;couldn't that small boy by the
door be coaxed to stay with me for company&mdash;I
couldn't bear to have Nancy's party
spoilt."</p>

<p>Judith knew how to be very persuasive and
Jack finally gave in. Little Pierre came with
them to carry the wood, he was told.</p>

<p>Jack opened up the house, carried in the
baskets of provisions, and lit a fire of blazing
logs.</p>

<p>"I'll 'phone to you when I get in, and if
you should need anything, or if you feel lonely,
ring up Mother in the meantime."</p>

<p>"I shan't have a minute to spare for feelings,"
declared Judith, "Pierre and I have
plenty to do."</p>

<p>She didn't quite realize how much was to
be done when she watched Jack drive off. The
living-room to be swept and dusted&mdash;that
would come first&mdash;and no small task when
one's arms and back are bruised and aching;
then to the kitchen, and judge of her dismay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
when on opening the baskets she found that,
though there were cakes and fruit and salad
stuff in plenty, of bread there was only one
small loaf. Whatever could&mdash;oh, here was
a small bag of flour and a tin of baking powder.
Judith groaned as she remembered hearing
Nancy tell Sally May that Mme. Berthier
was a splendid cook and had promised to make
heaps of waffles and hot biscuits for them to
eat with their baked beans and salad.</p>

<p>Twenty hungry skaters appearing in an
hour and one small loaf to feed them! Judith
had never made waffles, but she had made baking-powder
biscuits once or twice, though
only, of course, in small quantities. Her first
thought was to walk to Mme. Berthier's cottage
and ask for directions. No, that wouldn't
do&mdash;the precious hour would be gone. And
Nancy must <i>not</i> be disappointed.</p>

<p>"Put on some more wood, Pierre, please. I
want a good hot oven," she called to her little
helper, and then as he looked blank she tried
first her scanty stock of French words and then
showed him what to do.</p>

<p>While she was thinking, she was rapidly
unpacking the baskets and setting the table,
disregarding meanwhile the twinges of pain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
from her hurt shoulders. At last everything
was ready but the biscuits&mdash;she couldn't remember,
try as she might, the proportion of
baking-powder and flour and milk. A mistake
would be such a tragedy! Then just as she
had decided to make three or four batches and
hope that one or two might be good, she suddenly
thought of the telephone.</p>

<p>"Well, I am a silly, petit Pierre, now we'll
be all right&mdash;Yes, Mrs. Nairn, it's Judith&mdash;Jack
will explain&mdash;please tell me how to
make biscuits!"</p>

<p>The explanation must have been easy to
follow, for when Nancy and her party arrived
a little later three pans of beautifully browned
fluffy tea-biscuits were ready to put on the
table. Judith had never been as proud of
anything in her life as of those same biscuits,
and when later the company toasted her in
hot cocoa and sang, "For she's a Jolly Good
Fellow," with Nancy and Jack looking their
special thanks, Judith decided she could never
be any happier than she felt right then.</p>

<p>Mr. Nairn was as good as his word next
day and took them on a sight-seeing tour ending
with a delightful luncheon at the Ch&acirc;teau
Frontenac. Judith had never lunched in such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
a big hotel and felt very important and grown-up.
Jack and Tim refused to be instructed on
historical matters, but were on hand for the
luncheon.</p>

<p>"I guess you two have won Dad's hard
heart and no mistake," Jack confided to Judith
while they waited for Mr. Nairn, who was
speaking to an acquaintance. "I see the favors
are 'chien d'or' bonbon dishes," pointing to the
quaint little china dishes. "He always presents
a copy of 'The Golden Dog' to highly
honored visitors."</p>

<p>"Your father has been telling us about it,"
said Judith, "and he promised me a copy when
we get home."</p>

<p>"I'm coming back to sketch here some summer,"
announced Sally May; "Quebec's simply
full of places wanting to be painted."</p>

<p>After the luncheon the boys took them home,
and as Judith was still tired from her exertions
of the last two days, they voted to spend
the afternoon at home, and curled themselves
up in comfortable chairs in the sitting-room
prepared to discuss a box of chocolates and
the universe in general.</p>

<p>"What're you going to do after school,
Judy?" demanded Nancy; and then without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
waiting for an answer&mdash;"I believe Mother
is going to let me train to be a nurse. I've
just been crazy to be a nurse ever since I was
about ten. Mother has laughed at me and
said I would get over it, but she sees that I
really mean it, and I think she is willing now.
I don't know where I'll go. Florence Matthews
says you can get the best training in
New York, but Mother thinks New York is too
far away, and anyway I have to take a Domestic
Science course first."</p>

<p>"You'll look perfectly sweet in a uniform,
Nancy," said Sally May; "I simply adore
the kerchiefs the nurses wear in some of
the hospitals. It's too bad the war is over.
Wouldn't it have been thrilling to nurse
soldiers!"</p>

<p>"I'm going to be an artist," Sally May continued,
"with a studio in New York. I'm
going to buy all sorts of lovely embroidery
and pottery in the East&mdash;I know a perfectly
lovely shop in Shanghai&mdash;and I'll make a
gorgeous room. I'm sure I could make it perfectly
fascinating, full of atmosphere, you
know," she continued vaguely. "I'll have
afternoon tea every day and invite heaps of
people, interesting people, who do out-of-the-ordinary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
things. Patricia Caldwell's cousin
had the loveliest time. Patricia says her studio
is just like an old-fashioned French salon."</p>

<p>"What about your pictures?" asked Judith
slyly.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course I'll work hard," said Sally
May happily. "I simply love to draw."</p>

<p>"What are you going to be, Judy?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure," said Judith slowly, "but
I think I'd like to be a teacher."</p>

<p>"A teacher?" chorused the other two in surprise.
"Why, Judy, what a funny idea!"
said Sally May.</p>

<p>"I don't see why it's funny," Judith objected.
"I think it would be splendid to be like
Miss Marlowe or head of a school like Miss
Meredith."</p>

<p>"Well, you'll never get married if you are
a teacher," said Sally May with finality; "at
any rate, not for ages and ages."</p>

<p>"Why not?" said Judy.</p>

<p>This was a poser.</p>

<p>"W-e-l-l&mdash;you'd have to learn so much,
you see."</p>

<p>Judith laughed. "I hadn't thought of that,
but I thought you were going to be an artist,"
she added teasingly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>"But not all my life," expostulated Sally
May, and Judith and Nancy laughed to
think of Sally May's picture of a hard-working
artist.</p>

<p>Judith considered the matter of her future
seriously as she dressed for dinner.</p>

<p>It might be nice to be married&mdash;think how
lonely she and Mummy would be without
Daddy&mdash;but of course she couldn't marry
Daddy; and then she laughed at herself as
she remembered Daddy's story of the small
girl who sobbed that she didn't ever want to
get married because, as she couldn't have
daddy, she'd have to marry a perfect stranger.</p>

<p>"Perhaps some one like Tim would be nice,"
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'though'">thought</ins> Judith, and after the fashion of most
sixteen-year-olds she began to weave a shadowy
romance with a Prince Charming as its central
figure. Tim had walked to the Ch&acirc;teau with
them this morning, and although he had not
condescended to talk beyond the merest civilities,
this silence had merely served to enhance
his romantic value in Judith's eyes. She wondered
what he was thinking of. Perhaps he
was living over again a battle in the clouds&mdash;as
a matter of fact, Tim was wondering why
he hadn't received a certain letter which he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
had hoped for on Christmas Day. Judith
hoped he would like her new frock, and wondered
how many dances he would ask her for
on New Year's night.</p>

<p>The Nairns were a musical family. Nancy
always went to the piano and played for her
father after dinner, sometimes Mrs. Nairn
joined in with her violin, and to-night Tim
appeared with his 'cello.</p>

<p>Judith loved to attend symphony concerts
and the tuning-up of the orchestra never failed
to give her delicious thrills, but she had never
had a speaking acquaintance&mdash;so to speak&mdash;with
a 'cello before this, and the beautiful mellow
tones delighted her more than anything
she had ever heard before. As she undressed
that night she revised her plans for the future.
She would devote herself to music and study
hard so that when they were married she might
be her husband's accompanist. "On wings
of music" they would soar, and when they
did come back to earth it must be to a bungalow,
a dear little grey-stone bungalow. She
spent a happy time planning the furnishing
of her music-room and fell asleep before she
had decided on the respective merits of old
oak and mahogany.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Next day began with "Happy New Year"
and ended with the jolliest of family parties.
All the members of the house-party spent a
busy day, for Mrs. Nairn had plenty for the two
maids to do in the kitchen. Sally May was
discovered to have a talent for decorating,
so she and Jack and Tim hung evergreens
and holly and placed ferns and flowers where
they would show to the best advantage, while
Nancy and Judith whisked about with dusters
and brushes.</p>

<p>"Music in the living-room, dancing in the
drawing-room and hall, and cards upstairs in
Mother's sitting-room," said Nancy as they
set the small tables. "That's what we always
have, and then everybody dances a Sir Roger
de Coverly&mdash;you should see Uncle Phil and
Aunt Maria dancing&mdash;and afterwards we
have supper."</p>

<p>They had a picnic tea at six o'clock in the
sitting-room as the maids were arranging the
supper-table in the dining-room, and then
came the fun of dressing.</p>

<p>Judith had kept her new silver frock as a
great surprise, and now it was thrilling to burst
into Nancy's room in all her new finery. Nancy
and Sally May said it was "perfectly sweet,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and even Jack, "who never notices" (according
to Nancy), looked and whistled his admiration
as Judith came downstairs, her eyes
shining, her cheeks glowing with excitement,
and her pretty frock swishing about her in a
highly gratifying manner.</p>

<p>Guests were arriving at an unfashionably
early hour, since it was largely a family party,
and Judith was introduced to a bewildering
number of cousins and cousins' cousins and
aunts and uncles.</p>

<p>But where was Tim? He had not been
home for tea, and although Judith listened and
watched there was no sign of him.</p>

<p>"Tim went out early this afternoon to pay
calls and he isn't back yet," Sally May informed
Judith. "I think Mrs. Nairn is rather
worried about him."</p>

<p>The younger set had been dancing for an
hour or more and Jack had proved an attentive
host, but Judith was still half unconsciously
looking for Tim when suddenly she saw him
in the doorway with an exquisitely pretty girl
beside him. Perhaps it was Tim's radiant
look which he was making no effort to hide,
perhaps it was his partner's radiant looks
which she was trying to hide, but however it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
was Judith had the quick conviction that this
was a very special partner. The newcomer
was slim and graceful, and Judith saw with
sudden envy that her hair was like spun gold
and her eyes as blue as forget-me-nots.</p>

<p>Tim danced with no one else, and in spite
of Jack's attentions and no lack of interesting
partners, Judith began to feel a little disconsolate.
However, it was hard not to be merry
at such a merry party; there was happiness in
the very air.</p>

<p>The Sir Roger was a great success, and
Uncle Phil, aged seventy-two, upheld his reputation
as the gayest dancer of them all.</p>

<p>At supper-time Nancy and Judith were
helping to serve the little tables in the library
when Judith saw Tim with his partner come
in and go over to Mr. and Mrs. Nairn. Nancy
suddenly squeezed Judith's arm.</p>

<p>"Oh, Judy, Judy, they're engaged! I'm
sure they are! Look at Tim! We were
pretty sure he was in love with her, and Lois
is such a darling!"</p>

<p>Then she rushed over to put her arms around
Lois, and Judith was left alone feeling bereaved
of husband, home, and career at one
cruel stroke.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"The nicest party I ever was at," said Sally
May enthusiastically as the three said good-night
after a long discussion of the evening's
fun, "and I think you looked nicer than anybody
else, Judy. I do hope you won't get
conceited about the way you look in that new
frock. I know I should."</p>

<p>"The nicest party I ever was at," thought
Judith before she fell asleep, "and the very
nicest people. Jack is a brick&mdash;he's been awfully
kind to me. I wish I was half as pretty
as Lois Selkirk. What <i>would</i> it feel like to
be engaged?&mdash;I guess it would be exciting!
However, then I wouldn't be going back to
York Hill&mdash;and that will be exciting next
term and no mistake. Oh, how glad I am that
I've got Nancy!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>THE ANONYMOUS LETTER</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">What</span> fun it was to get back to York Hill!</p>

<p>As Judith stood in the front hall waiting
her turn to sign the register, she almost laughed
aloud as she remembered how, standing in this
very spot, she had clung desperately to Aunt
Nell five short months ago. How different
it was now! She could hardly wait to get
over to South, and see Nancy, and Catherine,
and Jane, and Josephine, and all the rest of
them.</p>

<p>She peeped into the drawing-room, and
there sat a stiff, solemn little figure&mdash;a new
girl, no doubt&mdash;and, yes, here was Eleanor
bringing Peggy Forrest to introduce to the
newcomer. And as Judith ran across to her
own house, she felt a warm glow of gratitude
that Miss Meredith had chosen Nancy
to be her "pilot" during those first difficult
days.</p>

<p>Cries of welcome greeted her in the corridor.</p>

<p>"Hi, there, Judibus! Had a good time?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sally May was looking for you, Judy."</p>

<p>"Good old Scrooge!"</p>

<p>"Merry Christmas, everybody&mdash;Happy
New Year to all the world," quoted Judith
promptly, seizing her letters and making her
way through the crowd around Miss Marlowe's
door down to the good old "Jolly Susan" and
Nancy.</p>

<p>Yes, there was Nancy's pretty yellow head,
and in another minute she was looking into
Nancy's merry eyes and trying to answer three
questions at once and say "hullo" to Josephine
and Jane and Sally May.</p>

<p>Judith was the last to arrive, so they all
crowded into her room and sampled Aunt
Nell's Christmas cake&mdash;thoughtfully provided
for the occasion&mdash;and the big box of chocolates
which Josephine's brother had sent.</p>

<p>Five tongues wagged merrily in spite of
cake and candy, for there were endless things
to tell&mdash;Josephine had been to her first real
dance, and Jane had been down to New York
with Phyllis Lovell, and you may be sure that
Nancy and Judith were not behind the others
in their accounts of "perfectly gorgeous"
times. And when Catherine joined them and
added her tale of a gay winter f&ecirc;te in Winnipeg,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Judith felt that no home-coming <i>could</i>
be happier.</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't it nice to <i>belong!</i>" said Judith to
herself as she dressed for supper. "I wonder
how that new girl is getting on&mdash;I guess she's
in our form when Eleanor got Peggy for her&mdash;I
wish I could do something to make her
feel at home&mdash;"</p>

<p>Josephine's head appeared in the door and
she whispered mysteriously, "Come on down
to the common room when you've finished."</p>

<p>"What <i>do</i> you think," she said when Judith
joined her, "that mean Genevieve Singleton
has been trying to get in here in Jane's room!
Jane said once at the beginning of last term
that she wished she was down in Peggy Forrest's
cubicles, but that was ages ago. Genevieve
went to Miss Marlowe and said that
Jane wanted to change her room, and may
she please have Jane's room, as she hasn't been
very well during the holidays and her mother
doesn't want her to climb stairs. Miss Marlowe
sent for Jane, and you should have heard
her when she came back! Genevieve is in
Catherine's room now telling her how heartbroken
she is, I suppose. Silly thing, I wish
she would try holding <i>my</i> hand."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>Judith laughed at Josephine's disgusted expression,
and blushed a little as she remembered
her own foolishness about Catherine.</p>

<p>"Genevieve's queer, isn't she? I can't make
her out&mdash;you remember how crazy she was
about Helen, and Helen didn't seem to like
her a bit."</p>

<p>"She's a silly owl," said Josephine decidedly,
"but&mdash;my word&mdash;wasn't she a
dandy Malvolio?"</p>

<p>At supper Judith, who was talking as hard
as any one else, realized what a Babel of sound
they were making when she saw the bewildered
look on the face of the new girl whose name
she learned was Florence Newman. She smiled
across at Florence in a friendly manner and
said, "Did you know that we're going to
dance afterwards&mdash;give me the first spare one
you have, will you&mdash;and I want to introduce
you to Josephine Burley&mdash;she's from Alberta,
too&mdash;and she's a perfect dear, although she
doesn't look it."</p>

<p>The talk about Christmas presents and parties
and new frocks and next term's doings
buzzed on, but Florence felt less lonely and
frightened. The "girl from Alberta" sounded
friendly and comforting: <i>she</i> would know what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
this turmoil meant after the silence of the
prairies.</p>

<p>Judith was as good as her word and shared
with Peggy the duty of "piloting" the new
member of Form Five. But she found Florence
very quiet and unresponsive, and gradually
the excitement of the new class in figure-skating
and the inter-form and house hockey
matches absorbed her attention.</p>

<p>There was plenty of hard work done in the
various classes, and the staff congratulated
themselves that the School was in good working
form, but, judging from the conversation
in the sitting-room and at table, the girls apparently
did nothing but think and talk and
play hockey and figure-skating.</p>

<p>Judith did not join a hockey team, but
Josephine was one of the Junior captains, and
as she kept the crew of the "Jolly Susan"
well informed as to the "points" of her team,
Judith was an interested "fan" at all the
matches.</p>

<p>There were two cups given for the fancy
skating and Judith and Nancy resolved to
enter the competition. After a long morning
in the classroom they could hardly wait to get
out to the rink to begin again on the figure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
eight. A beautiful curve seemed the most important
thing in the world.</p>

<p>The rink these zero days was a pretty sight.
Miss Meredith, on her way out for a walk,
used to love to stand for a few minutes and
watch the charming scene. "What lovely
things girls are," she would murmur to herself
as they flashed by in their bright-coloured caps
and coats, their cheeks glowing and eyes bright
from the wholesome exercise in the ozone-laden
air.</p>

<p>Judith did not win a cup, "but it was great
fun trying for it, Mummy," she wrote to her
mother, "and Patricia did beautifully. Aunt
Nell says I have lost my stoop, so perhaps
that's my reward instead of the cup, and I
think I must have gained another five pounds.
We're so hungry when we come in for supper
that I believe we'd eat our books&mdash;if there
were nothing more appetising!</p>

<p>"We had great fun last night at a sleighing
party&mdash;the Domestic Science Form invited
forty of us and you may be sure we accepted.
We were bundled up in all the warm clothes
we owned, and there was lots of straw in the
bottom of the sleigh. We packed into two big
sleighs, and as soon as we got out into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
country we sang songs, and tooted horns, and
had an awfully good time. Josephine said she
was 'glad to goodness' it was a Domestic Science
party, for the eats were sure to be good,
and they sure were! I never was so hungry in
my life."</p>

<p>Then it was Five A's turn to entertain, and
after an enormous amount of talking they decided
on a skating party. The invitation list
gave the committee a great deal of trouble.
It grew and grew until they realized that they
never could afford to feed such a large and
hungry mob. Nancy, who had been elected
Form President on her return, took the difficulty
to Miss Marlowe and she came out of
the study with a beaming face.</p>

<p>"Miss Marlowe's a brick," she announced.
"She says that if we are going to have a hurdy-gurdy
and coloured lanterns and a moonlight
night, why not ask everybody; the House'll
provide cocoa and Chelsea buns, and we can
get any extra cakes we like ourselves." And
so it was happily arranged.</p>

<p>Nancy proved herself a born organizer, and
on Friday evening each Five A girl shared in
the duty of being hostess. Even Florence,
who remained persistently quiet and difficult<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
to know, was given her share of work to do.
Sally May and her committee were responsible
for decorating the supper-room, Peggy Forrest
was to look after the coloured lanterns,
Judith was to see that the smiling Italian and
his wife, who took turns at the hurdy-gurdy,
each had a rest in the warm kitchen and some
supper, "and be sure," cautioned wise Nancy,
"that the maids keep back enough for our own
supper afterwards."</p>

<p>Friday afternoon saw Form Five A hard at
work getting ready for their guests. Nancy
flew hither and thither; she worked out on the
rink helping with the lanterns, and down in
the supper-room with the decorations, and
then she was off to the housekeeper's room
with a list of special requests. She was making
a splendid Form President, every one agreed,
and that was very high praise, for the post was
by no means an easy one to fill.</p>

<p>So far Nancy's chief difficulty had been in
keeping silence when the form was lined up
ready to lead into morning prayers, but later
on in the year she was to tackle the problem
of how to deal with persistent petty cheating
which remained undiscovered by the authorities.
The Form Mistress may be a wise counsellor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
and a constant friend, but the Form
President is often&mdash;as Nancy was later on&mdash;kept
from seeking advice by the schoolgirl's
horror of "telling tales."</p>

<p>By six o'clock everything was ready for the
skating party, and Five A went in to supper
with a good appetite and the happy consciousness
that they were going to have a good time.</p>

<p>"Glistening snow, tingling air, glittering
stars, shining moon," said Judith gleefully, as
she and Sally May waltzed on the ice, while
Peggy was turning on the coloured lights.
"It's going to be a perfectly blissful party."</p>

<p>And it was. The night was perfect to begin
with, and the Chinese lanterns and the music
of the hurdy-gurdy all combined to form a
scene of magic enchantment that fairly entranced
beauty-loving Judith.</p>

<p>The snow lay about the rink in a great glistening
white bank, splashed here and there by
a pool of coloured light, far away glittered the
stars in a dark blue winter sky, and over all
the moon shed a pure, cold, white light.</p>

<p>Form Five didn't stop to think about the
beauty around them, but they enjoyed it nevertheless.
What a good time they had! They
waltzed&mdash;those who could&mdash;and they "cracked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
the whip," and they hummed the tunes the
Italian was industriously grinding out, and
they laughed and shouted and were perfectly
happy. Judith had three "bands" with Nancy,
and two with Catherine who looked exquisitely
lovely, and what more could heart desire? Indeed,
as she and Nancy drank their third cup
of cocoa and divided the last piece of chocolate
cake, she agreed enthusiastically that she had
never had such a "perfectly gorgeous time in
all her born days!"</p>

<p>The fine cold weather lasted for almost six
weeks, and then quite suddenly came an unmistakable
thaw.</p>

<p>"If only it had come in January," sighed
Miss Evans as she surveyed the dirty pond,
which had once been a rink, "but it is too late
in the season now to hope for steady skating
again."</p>

<p>She was justified in her pessimism; the skating
season was over. Every girl in the School
regarded the dull weather almost as a personal
insult, and every teacher in the School realized
that the most difficult weeks of the year had
now to be faced, for unless precautions were
taken, sickness and mischief were bound to
flourish in this in-between-seasons time. Wise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Miss Meredith marshalled her forces and took
counsel with the Heads of Houses; the gymnasium
staff put on extra dancing classes, and
indoor basket-ball matches, but in spite of all
their efforts many of the girls seemed languid
and uninterested.</p>

<p>Nancy, who seemed to hear more news than
her mates in the "Jolly Susan," burst into
Judith's room late next afternoon during the
dressing hour.</p>

<p>"What do you think? Genevieve Singleton
got an anonymous letter in the evening mail
and she is upstairs now crying in her room."</p>

<p>"An anonymous letter," repeated Josephine
from the next room. "I'd like to know
what sort?&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Nancy excitedly, paying no
attention to Josephine, "nobody knows who
wrote it, and it was about Catherine." She
paused to enjoy the full effect of this mysterious
bit of gossip.</p>

<p>Judith, whose hair was only half-done, put
down her brush and demanded impatiently&mdash;</p>

<p>"What about Catherine?"</p>

<p>"Well, you know very well, Judy, that
Genevieve has a crush on Catherine. Why,
Cathy had fairly to put her out of her room the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
other day, and on Wednesday evening, when
we were dancing after evening prep., I heard
her tell Genevieve that she wouldn't dance
with her again until she stopped being such a
goose."</p>

<p>"But the letter?" said Judith.</p>

<p>"I'm coming to that. It was printed and I
can't remember it exactly, but it was something
like this:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Don't hang around Catherine Ellison any more, Genevieve
Singleton, she can't bear the sight of you. A word
to the wise is sufficient.</p></div>

<div class='unindent'>She is crying like anything and Peggy Forrest
says it is a perfect shame."</div>

<p>"What's a perfect shame?" asked Josephine
pointedly.</p>

<p>"Why, the meanness of the person who sent
that letter," said Nancy; "whoever did it, is
a mean horrid thing, every one says so."</p>

<p>Every one was having one opinion or another,
for the news spread like wildfire throughout
the house, and at tea-time poor Catherine
knew that this choice piece of gossip was
being discussed at every table. She was not
long left in ignorance as to the fact that some
of the girls thought that she herself had written<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the note in order to get rid of an unwelcome
visitor, who was very difficult to snub. Other
girls, who had resented the prefect's attitude
towards crushes, expressed great sympathy
for Genevieve, and there was much speculation
as to the probable author of the letter.</p>

<p>Catherine took counsel with Eleanor and
they decided that it was a tempest in a teapot
and that Genevieve would be quite all right
by to-morrow. However, next day Genevieve's
eyes were still red and she began to
assume the attitude of an early Christian
martyr.</p>

<p>Catherine, who had been very much vexed
by the whole affair, felt remorseful. "Poor
Genevieve," she thought, "she's feeling very
badly. I can't help wondering why she let the
others see the note; but there is no use judging;
I'd better go and say good-night to her."
This last was looked upon as an act of special
favour and condescension on the part of a prefect,
and Catherine felt that she was being very
magnanimous.</p>

<p>In the visiting time before "lights out" bell,
she tapped at Genevieve's door and to her dismay
Genevieve flung her arms round her neck.</p>

<p>"Oh, Catherine, say you didn't mean it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mean what, you silly?" replied Catherine,
crossly realizing that every girl within hearing
distance was pricking up her ears. "Surely
you don't imagine that I would stoop to write
an anonymous letter."</p>

<p>"No-o," stammered Genevieve, "but I am
sure you don't like me"&mdash;and she began to
sob afresh. "I can't bear you to dislike me.
Do say that I may still come to your room
sometimes."</p>

<p>Catherine was only human, if she <i>was</i> eighteen
and a prefect, and although annoyed with
Genevieve, she was touched by the genuine
distress on the girl's face.</p>

<p>"Of course you may come, silly," she said.
"Dry your eyes and do try to be sensible and
don't talk that way any more," she added, sitting
down on the edge of the bed, where to
Genevieve's delight she sat and gossiped about
sundry School matters&mdash;to the great edification
of the surrounding cubicles&mdash;until the
bell rang.</p>

<p>Next day, to the astonishment of the inmates
of the "Jolly Susan," Genevieve simply
haunted Catherine's room, and on the following
day they could hear poor Catherine getting
rid of her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>"Really, Genevieve," they heard her say as
she opened the door, "you are too foolish. Do
run along; I must finish my essay for Miss
Marlowe, and I dare say you have <i>something</i>
to do," with a sarcasm not lost upon her
hearers, who grinned appreciatively, for Genevieve
was noted for the ingenuity with which
she escaped anything like work.</p>

<p>Next day when the girls hurried out of afternoon
study as the five o'clock bell rang, they
made their usual wild rush for the mail-box.
One would have thought that every girl in the
school expected most important news. Suddenly
a little choking cry was heard, and Genevieve,
who had taken out her letter and was
standing at one side of the group, turned white,
as she drew out from its envelope another
printed letter. Here was sensation, indeed!
Several of her friends pressed closely around
her to read it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Can't you take a hint, Genevieve Singleton? Stay in
your own part of the house. Catherine simply hates the
sight of you.</p></div>

<p>Tears ran down Genevieve's face as she re-read
this precious epistle and then crumpling
the paper in her hands she ran to her room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Sympathizing friends followed, and "Poor
Genevieve!" was heard on all sides.</p>

<p>Judith had been a distressed spectator of
this scene. How sorry Catherine would be!
How sorry she was for Catherine! Whoever
could be writing the letters?</p>

<p>This, indeed, was the sole topic of conversation
in the "Jolly Susan" during the dressing-hour,
and before the evening was over the
School was enjoying a thoroughly good gossip.
One amateur detective had suggested
that jealousy must be the motive of the unknown
writer, for most of the girls dismissed
the suggestion that Catherine was the author.
Some one else contributed the story of Genevieve's
unsuccessful attempt to obtain a room
in the "Jolly Susan," and then some one, who
had overheard Sally May's indignation thereat,
suggested Sally May as a likely culprit.</p>

<p>As was inevitable these mere suppositions
grew by their many tellings into "facts," and
by the next evening many of the girls were
convinced that Sally May, "who is absolutely
devoted to Catherine, my dear," was "wildly
jealous of Genevieve," and was actually "seen
putting a letter into the box."</p>

<p>Miss Marlowe, who remains in the back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>ground
in this story, but whom we must never
forget, sits in the midst of South House like
some omniscient and benevolent providence,
decided that something must be done to stop
these mischievous wagging tongues, so she
summoned her prefects and said frankly:</p>

<p>"A little bird has told me something about
these anonymous letters. I know they are
very trivial and silly, but when one girl begins
to be accused by the others, it is time to clean
up the matter. From what I know of Sally
May, I cannot believe that she has written
them. Don't tell me anything more about it.
I leave it to you; please do your best to get
them stopped." And she left them to solve
the puzzle.</p>

<p>The prefects held a meeting at once and
decided that the matter was not serious enough
to call a special house meeting. Such meetings
called and addressed by the captain were
held on very special occasions, and this&mdash;"Well,
this is <i>too</i> silly," said Patricia Caldwell,
giggling. "Poor Cathy! its a pity you
are so bewitching. I don't know how you will
manage your affairs after you leave school,"
she added teasingly. "I'm afraid the morning
papers will have to devote front-page<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
space to the duels fought in Miss Catherine
Ellison's honour."</p>

<p>Catherine could stand being chaffed by her
peers and equals, but she really hated the gossip
of the younger girls.</p>

<p>It was decided that every prefect was to
keep ears and eyes open and report to Eleanor
anything suspicious. A special watch was to
be kept on the mail-box. Two prefects were
to make it their business to saunter past the
box whenever they could and keep an eye on
pigeon-hole "S." Perhaps they might catch
the criminal at the box.</p>

<p>There was much laughter about it, and with
the exception of Catherine they rather enjoyed
the importance and the mystery. They realized,
however, that so much gossiping was
bad for the tone of the house. "It must be
stopped."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>JUDITH PLAYS DETECTIVE</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">While</span> the prefects were sitting in solemn
conclave, Judith at her desk, writing to her
mother, found that the story of the week's
doings centred about Genevieve and the mysterious
letter.</p>

<p>"She is hard to describe, Mummy," she
wrote; "she isn't exactly pretty, but her face
changes so often when she is talking that she
is interesting to listen to. She doesn't play
many games and I don't see very much of her,
but you remember I told you how clever she
was as Malvolio in 'Twelfth Night.' She acts
awfully well and she just loves doing it. And
she's always getting frightfully fond of somebody
and feeling badly if they don't like her."
Judith sat rolling her pen absent-mindedly up
and down her blotter as the picture of Genevieve
filled her mind.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was a matter of "thinking of
angels and hearing their wings"; at any rate,
just at this moment, Genevieve, returning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
from a fruitless attempt to catch Catherine in
her room, knocked at Judith's door.</p>

<p>"Come on down and see me, Judy," she
begged; "I've got some biscuits and some
Washington coffee and I'll beg some hot
water from Mrs. Bronson."</p>

<p>Judith who loved coffee needed no second
bidding, and was soon enjoying a steaming
cup and listening to Genevieve's woes; but
Genevieve was scarcely well started on the
subject of the letters when a heavy step was
heard in the corridor and she jumped up in
alarm.</p>

<p>"Throw the coffee out the window, Judy,"
she begged&mdash;"that's Miss Watson doing
laundry&mdash;she's in Joan's room now." And
with amazing swiftness she emptied her laundry
bag on the bed, covered the contents with
her eiderdown, spread out two dainty sets of
immaculate French underwear, and was seated
with a darning-basket and a pair of stockings
in her hand, before the astonished Judith could
take in the significance of her actions.</p>

<p>"Come in," said Genevieve sweetly as Miss
Watson knocked. "Oh, is that you, Miss
Watson? I'm just finishing my stockings."</p>

<p>Miss Watson, who was short-sighted and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
bit indolent, hated the weekly task of inspecting
the newly returned laundry in search of
missing buttons and rents, all of which were to
be recorded in her little black book and checked
off when the owners testified that the said
garments had been made whole. So remembering
the immaculate clothes which awaited
her each week in Genevieve's room, she made a
cursory examination of the dainty undies and
checked O.K. opposite Genevieve's name.</p>

<p>"There's a funny odor in here," she commented
as she turned to go; "you haven't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Genevieve politely, "I've just
had a hot drink. Mrs. Bronson thought I'd
better have one because I felt so tired."</p>

<p>And Judith, watching with wide-open eyes,
to her amazement saw Genevieve's sensitive
mobile face actually grow tired and sad-looking
while she watched, and then the moment
Miss Watson was safely out of sight, with a
slight grimace and shrug Genevieve was smiling
triumphantly at her own cleverness, and
slyly watching the effect of it all on Judith.</p>

<p>"You'll keep it dark?" she asked, realizing
that wholesale neatness would arouse Miss
Watson's suspicions and that the game would
be up.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly," said Judith a little stiffly, wondering
that Genevieve would ask her&mdash;Nancy
wouldn't have, nor Josephine; but then neither
would Nancy have taken advantage of Miss
Watson's short sight in order to present each
week the same set of underwear kept especially
for the purpose.</p>

<p>"Yes; certainly she's clever, but she's got
queer ideas about some things," thought Judith
as Genevieve began again on the meanness of
the person who wrote the anonymous letter.</p>

<p>"I'd give anything I've got," was Genevieve's
parting word, "if I could find out who
did it."</p>

<p>"So would I," was Judith's thought as she
dressed for a walk. "We've just <i>got</i> to find
out, for Sally May and Catherine look perfectly
wretched&mdash;as if Sally May <i>would;</i> but
some of them believe it. <i>How</i> Genevieve can
act! She just hoodwinked Miss Watson completely;
looked like a good little prig who'd
done everything she ought to do&mdash;and she was
thoroughly enjoying herself. I guess she'll
go on the stage when she leaves school&mdash;it
would be interesting to have people applauding.
I believe she was glad I was there to see
her do it&mdash;and I believe&mdash;she was glad the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
girls were round to sympathize when she got
the letter&mdash;"</p>

<p>Perhaps it was because of her determination
to help Sally May and Catherine, perhaps
because of the little scene she had just witnessed,
or perhaps for no particular reason at
all, suddenly a new, and at first glance a crazy,
idea popped into her mind.</p>

<p>What if Genevieve enjoyed an audience so
much that she wrote the anonymous letter
herself!</p>

<p>"Well that <i>is</i> a silly idea&mdash;think how she
cried and cried&mdash;yes, but she had Cathy sympathizing
with her&mdash;"</p>

<p>Judith started out to find Nancy to share
her idea, but before she found her she decided
she'd say nothing about it&mdash;it was too far-fetched.
Nevertheless, she determined to keep
an eye on Miss Genevieve.</p>

<p>Next morning, according to the prefects'
plans, Patricia and Catherine haunted the
front corridor. Patricia even took up a post
just inside the sitting-room door and watched
through the crack, but the corridor was deserted
all morning. Helen and Esther took
the afternoon watch and had no better luck.</p>

<p>Esther saw the mistress distribute the evening<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
mail, putting several letters into pigeon-hole
"S," which had been empty until now,
and then came a rush of fifty girls crowding
round the box. Esther reported afterwards
to Eleanor that whoever did it managed very
quickly, for she was watching all the time.
Genevieve put up her hand, drew out of
pigeon-hole "S" another printed letter, and
with a faint cry collapsed in a dead faint. At
least so her condition was described to those
few who were not privileged to be present.
Ambulance classes had not been held in vain at
York Hill, and in less time than it takes to tell
Genevieve found herself on the sofa in the
housekeeper's room, where she proceeded to
indulge in an old-fashioned fit of hysterics.</p>

<p>Judith, who had helped carry her in, wanted
to stay and see, if possible, whether Genevieve
were shamming, but Mrs. Bronson shooed
them all out saying that Genevieve must have
an hour's rest and then she could go to the
Infirmary.</p>

<p>Judith returned to the corridor where she
found excited groups discussing this third
terrible letter. Some of the girls talked with
lowered voices and several looked almost as
white as Genevieve had, and when our heroine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
entered the "Jolly Susan," it was as little like
its name as possible. Sally May was sobbing
audibly and Nancy was trying in vain to comfort her.</p>

<p>"Horrid things! I hate them all. Why
should they think I would do such a nasty
trick?" she heard between the sobs.</p>

<p>Josephine appeared in Judith's doorway.</p>

<p>"It's a shame, isn't it?" she whispered. "I
would like to knock their silly heads together.
I don't wonder Sally's mad, and I believe that
Catherine is crying, too."</p>

<p>Judith was horrified.</p>

<p>"Catherine crying! Why in the world should
she cry?"</p>

<p>"Well, you know," said Josephine, "it's
rotten for her, and probably she believes that
Miss Marlowe thinks she has been silly, too.
I don't know for sure, but she wouldn't let
Eleanor in a few minutes ago, and her voice
sounded shaky."</p>

<p>This was awful! A prefect weeping!</p>

<p>Two days passed without any further development
and Eleanor was beginning to hope
that the nine days' wonder was at an end.
On Wednesday evening, however, Judith heard
Genevieve's protest when Catherine hurried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
off to a gymnasium class, after a vain effort to
get rid of a now increasingly unwelcome visitor.</p>

<p>"You don't have to go yet, Cathy. It's
five minutes before the bell will ring. Do stay
and talk to me; I'm awfully miserable."</p>

<p>But Catherine was evidently exasperated
and held the door open for Genevieve, who
had no choice but to go too.</p>

<p>"Now," said Judith inelegantly to Nancy,
"Genevieve will have another spasm."</p>

<p>Privately she resolved to play the detective.</p>

<p>She awoke next morning to hear the rain
falling steadily. "Ugh," she thought, "a rainy
day and my Latin isn't finished&mdash;two horrid
things to begin with." And then she remembered
her plans of the night before. Instantly
she was out of bed; she wouldn't try
to keep her secret any longer. Nancy should
share it, but she wouldn't tell Sally May until
she had caught Genevieve. Nancy was impressed
by Judith's cleverness in thinking of
such a thing, but doubtful about Genevieve's
guilt.</p>

<p>"Why, she cried and cried; I saw her,"
Nancy kept repeating. "She couldn't have
done it herself."</p>

<p>But Judith was not to be shaken in her resolve,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
and leaving the study room a little before
one o'clock she settled herself in Helen Richard's
cupboard to watch. Fortunately for
Judith's plan Helen was in the Infirmary with
a sore throat and through the keyhole of
her cupboard Judith had a clear view of the
letter-box.</p>

<p>At a quarter-to-one Miss Marlowe put out
the mail, but no one else came near the box
until one o'clock when every one came as
usual. Then, when everything was quiet again,
Judith slipped out and caught up with the
others as they went down to the dining-room.
Before dinner was quite over, she asked permission
to leave early, and she hid herself once
more in the cupboard.</p>

<p>The afternoon seemed interminably long,
and as the cupboard was stuffy and close, if it
had not been for Nancy's chocolates Judith
felt that she could not have kept awake. Her
knees ached horribly, for she was in a cramped
position, but she never dreamed of giving up, so
sure was she that something would happen.</p>

<p>And something did happen.</p>

<p>At a quarter-to-five the mail was put out,
and as no one had appeared, Judith was beginning
to think that she would have to watch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
another day, when suddenly she saw Genevieve
come swiftly down the corridor, pause for an
instant at the box, slip in a letter, and then
vanish as quickly as she had come.</p>

<p>Judith could hardly wait to get the letter
into her own hands. Yes, it was the now familiar
printed envelope.</p>

<div class='center'>
"Genevieve Singleton."<br />
</div>

<p>What should she do? Whom should she tell?
Nancy? Eleanor? Miss Marlowe? No; Catherine
was the one most concerned. Judith fairly
ran with the precious missive to Catherine's
room and fortunately found Catherine there
studying. Her story was soon told and Catherine
was scarcely less excited than Judith.</p>

<p>"Judy, you are the brickiest brick, and the
trumpest trump! Come here and let me shake
you. Hasn't it been horrid&mdash;such a little
thing, but everybody in such a stew," she
added in a confidential tone, which was ample
reward to Judith. "And now we can be rid
of her, the little wretch! Three cheers for the
first mate of the 'Jolly Susan!'"</p>

<p>The two of them went arm in arm down to
the Captain's room. Judith told her story
but so modestly and so simply that Eleanor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
forgot the necessity of "keeping a fifth-form
new girl in her place."</p>

<p>The six o'clock dressing-bell rang before
they could do more than decide to have a formal
prefects' meeting at which they would
confront Genevieve with the letter.</p>

<p>"She'll confess, of course, right away,"
whispered Catherine scornfully to Judith as
they went down to tea; "she's that sort."</p>

<p>And this proved to be a true prophecy.
Confronted by the prefects, sitting like judges
at their study table, Genevieve turned pale
and looked unmistakably guilty, and when
Eleanor said in her sternest voice: "You were
seen putting this letter, which you addressed
to yourself, in the letter-box," Genevieve made
no denials; she broke down and confessed to
all four letters. Her misery and humiliation
were so genuine and so overwhelming that
Eleanor wisely sent her to her room in the
care of Patricia, who could be trusted not to
give Genevieve too much sympathy.</p>

<p>Then the prefects faced the difficult question
of the culprit's punishment. Esther
wanted a special house meeting called at which
Genevieve and her ways could be denounced;
Catherine thought that a public apology should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
be made to Sally May, for Genevieve, it
seemed, was responsible for the spreading of
the false accusation; Helen remarked that Genevieve
would like nothing better than to be
the centre of such a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'romatic'">romantic</ins> picture, and she
added shrewdly, "Half the girls would make
a martyr of her and think we had been awfully
cruel and unfair."</p>

<p>Finally, after much discussion it was decided
that Eleanor should consult Miss Marlowe,
who must be informed that the culprit
had been discovered. Miss Marlowe was interested
and sympathetic.</p>

<p>"I'll send her to the Infirmary for a few
days," she said; "the child is really not well.
She is growing too fast and she is morbid and
self-centred. Every one thinks of her as seventeen
and she has just turned fifteen. Then
after she is back again let the facts be made
known about the letters; that's only fair to
Sally May and to Catherine; but do it as casually
as possible. Nothing is so bad for Genevieve
as too much attention&mdash;and keep an eye
on Judith," she added; "she is worth watching,
Eleanor. She and Nancy ought to be prefects
next year, so we mustn't let Judith be spoiled
over this."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>Genevieve was safely tucked up in one of
the cheerful Infirmary rooms, and for the time
she suffered as only a sensitive, highstrung
girl of fifteen can suffer. Her one interest in
life at the present time was her emotions; her
passionate attachments were usually short-lived,
but for the time being they blotted out
everything else. Just now she desired Catherine's
love and approval with all the force of
her undisciplined nature, and, born actress that
she was, it was the wish to attract Catherine's
admiration, or at least her attention, which had
made her Malvolio last term so outstandingly
good. She lacked a sense of proportion in all
her thinking, and even now that she had been
found out, and knew that she would be shamed
in the eyes of the whole school, the only thing
that mattered to her was that Catherine would
have even less to do with her than before.
Eleanor's stern voice might have been the buzzing
of a fly; Genevieve's eyes had been fixed
on Catherine's face and she had read her sentence
there.</p>

<p>For two whole days she wanted to die, and
then quite suddenly she transferred her affections
to a young nurse who was temporarily
assisting the school nurse. She made Miss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Burton promise her at least three dances for
the prefects' dance on Friday night, and she
did frantic sums in mental arithmetic trying to
calculate whether she had enough in the bank
to buy a posy of sweetheart roses for her new
idol's adornment.</p>

<p>Genevieve returned to school to find every
one discussing the dance, and the anonymous
letters seemed entirely forgotten. But Eleanor
found her opportunity a day or two later.
The usual crowd was about the letter-box at
five o'clock, and Eleanor noted with satisfaction
that both Sally May and Catherine were
there.</p>

<p>"Any for me?" she called to Sally May,
who was at the box.</p>

<p>"Not one," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," said Eleanor, clearly and distinctly,
"of course I can always follow Genevieve's
example and <i>write one to myself</i>, a
printed one, I mean; but no, on second thoughts
I don't believe I shall, they are rather horrid
things, don't you think?" And she walked
quietly away.</p>

<p>For days afterwards at mail-time Jane, who
loved to ride a joke&mdash;"till it died of sheer exhaustion,"
as Peggy said&mdash;could always raise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
a laugh at Genevieve's expense. "Any a-non-y-mous
letters for me?" she would inquire
plaintively. "No? I really must see about it.
I suppose I must attend to it myself."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>FRIENDS</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Easter</span> examinations, although a month away,
were already looming darkly on the horizon
and Judith settled down to a long and hard
pull.</p>

<p>"So much to learn and so little time," she
groaned to Nancy. "I'd like to spend all
my time on my essay for Miss Marlowe, but
there are French and geometry tests next week,
which need every minute of study time I have.
Why can't the days be forty hours long?"</p>

<p>However, most of the school thought the
days quite long enough, and in fact some
happy souls had already counted up the number
of hours until the holidays began and were
ticking them off with great glee.</p>

<p>Judith's delight in lesson hours was steadily
increasing. Even in mathematics classes which
she disliked, she was beginning to feel the joy
of triumphing over difficulties, and she looked
forward to her literature lessons as the happiest
hours of the week. Loving Nancy as she did,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Judith was always trying to share her enjoyment
of some beautiful lines of poetry or an
interesting scene in the play they were studying,
and not always with pronounced success.
Nancy's mind was of a practical turn; she was
very lukewarm about poetry.</p>

<p>"Listen to this," Judith had commanded
one day as she sat waiting for Nancy to finish
dressing for dinner:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Here will we sit, and let the sounds of music</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Creep in our ears; soft stillness and the night</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Become the touches of sweet harmony.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">There's not the smallest orb which thou beholdest</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But in his motion like an angel sings,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubims;</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>"Isn't that beautiful?"</div>

<p>"Y-e-s," said Nancy, "I suppose it is. The
words sound nice when you read them, but I'm
sure I haven't a ghost of an idea what it means.
Why does he put his ideas into poetry? Why
doesn't he say it out plainly so we could all
understand it without studying? It's an interesting
play, though I believe it is Miss Marlowe
who has made it so interesting," she added<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
shrewdly; "I mean if any one had given me
the 'Merchant of Venice' to read just like any
other book, I'd never have gotten through it.
Why can't Shakespeare say things right out
plain?"</p>

<p>This was a poser for Judith. "But," she
stammered, "it's like&mdash;like music. Music isn't
right out plain; it's <i>meant</i> to be beautiful."</p>

<p>"Nancy must be joking," thought Judith
as she tried to decide why the cherubims were
"young-eyed." But no; a few days later
Nancy was quite pettish about the preparation
Miss Marlowe had set them.</p>

<p>"Find three stanzas of poetry which you
could say are 'A joy forever.'"</p>

<p>"How do I know whether they are a joy
forever?" she demanded irately of Judith;
"I've been hunting for an hour and I can't
find any. I don't know what it's all about
most of the time."</p>

<p>"But didn't you like 'The Skylark,' and
'The Forsaken Merman,' and 'The <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Lotos'">Lotus</ins>-Eaters,'
and 'Ulysses,' and 'The Lady of
Shalott' and&mdash;oh, Nancy, there are lots to
choose from. Let's find some that sound nice
and some that have beautiful pictures in them."</p>

<p>They spent a happy hour together, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Judith loved poetry, and it was nice to share it
with Nancy.</p>

<p>Looking back afterwards that seemed to
Judith to be the last happy hour she had with
Nancy for some time. Judith hardly noticed
just when it began, but for some reason or
other Nancy and Sally May were together
now a great deal of their time.</p>

<p>"Choosing partners" was a sacred rite at
York Hill, and now it seemed that Nancy and
Sally May were always partners for walks,
for church, for the symphony concert, and for
Miss Meredith's dinner-party.</p>

<p>This last was a great disappointment to
Judith. Miss Meredith's dinner-parties were
very special treats; about once a fortnight she
entertained half a dozen girls at her own dinner-table
and, when Nancy had told Judith
about these parties, Judith had taken it for
granted that they would be partners if they
happened to be invited together. And now
Sally May was going with Nancy! An ugly
little spirit of jealousy began to whisper in
Judith's mind. Top Self listened to his hints
and surmises: "Nancy doesn't care about you
any more; she and Sally May have secrets
from you; perhaps they were laughing at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
you last night when you heard them whispering."
Deep-Down Self made protests,
"Why couldn't Nancy have two good friends?
Of course she still loves you; you can't expect
her to be always with you."</p>

<p>But Judith's heart was sore, and a teasing
remark of Sally May's as they were dressing
for the dinner entirely spoilt the evening for
her. Sally May came in to ask Judith to help
her with a difficult fastener, and she surveyed
Judith's reflection in the mirror while Judith
snapped the refractory dome.</p>

<p>"You look stunning, Judy; I'm sure that
if Tim could see you he would return the
compliment and say that you looked 'just
lovely,'" she added wickedly.</p>

<p>The colour flowed over Judith's face and
then receded leaving her quite white. So
Nancy had told Sally May about her foolish
speech in the Christmas holidays! How horrid
of her! How mean! Judith had almost forgotten
about Tim by this time, but her love
for Nancy had steadily grown, and Nancy had
been making fun of her behind her back!
Judith gave herself up to angry thoughts; almost
she hated Nancy; she wanted to go away,
to be alone, to hide some place; and instead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
she must go to this miserable dinner and perhaps
sit just across the table from Nancy.
The thought of Nancy's disloyalty hurt; it
hurt horribly.</p>

<p>Judith finished dressing, put on her wraps,
and went down to the sitting-room to wait for
the others. To her disgust she found Georgia
Fiske there, Georgia whom she positively disliked
for no reason at all and who looked up
at her now with a beaming smile.</p>

<p>"I was just thinking about you, Judy," she
said, "and wondering if you had a partner.
Do sit beside me. I'd have asked you before,
but I didn't know you were going till just a
few minutes ago."</p>

<p>Poor Judith!&mdash;there was apparently no
escape; she must sit beside Georgia, and listen
to her silly remarks. Judith was in no mood
to be fair to any one; she hated Georgia, she
hated Sally May, she hated Nancy.</p>

<p>The dinner-party was a failure as far as
Judith was concerned. Miss Meredith, stately
and dignified in black velvet and beautiful old
lace, was a charming hostess, and the girls
were soon talking naturally and easily. Judith
looked down the table at Nancy; she didn't
want to look at her and yet she must. Nancy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
radiating friendliness and good-humor, smiled
at Judith as much as to say, "Isn't it jolly?"
But Judith hardened her heart and pretended
that she didn't see her. The ice-cream was
delicious and the tiny cups of black coffee afterwards
made them feel very grown-up, and
every one but Judith seemed perfectly happy.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Judy?" whispered
Nancy, as they went into the drawing-room,
for Judith not only felt miserable, she looked
miserable&mdash;so much so that Miss Meredith
made a mental note to ask Miss Marlowe to
keep an eye on her and find out if anything
were troubling her.</p>

<p>"Nothing's the matter," said Judith coldly,
turning away and calling out to Frances to
wait for her.</p>

<p>Nancy felt rebuffed, but loyally sought to
find excuses for her friend. "She's been
working too hard over that Jessica essay," she
said to herself; "she looks awfully tired."</p>

<p>Then followed a miserable week. Judith was
both jealous and angry; she felt that in telling
Sally May what she had said about Tim, Nancy
had betrayed their friendship. It was true that
Nancy and Sally May were much together;
they were making scenery for the Studio Play<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
and were spending many spare hours upstairs
working under Miss Ashwell's direction.
Judith knew about the play, but she was too
angry to be reasonable, so she shut herself up
in her books and avoided Nancy as much as
possible.</p>

<p>Nancy knew quite well now that something
had come between Judith and her, and she
made two more attempts to find out what was
wrong so that if possible things might be
righted, but each time Judith rebuffed her,
and Nancy was too busy to spend much time
coaxing. Sally May, who was held to be a wise
little person, told Nancy not to worry.</p>

<p>"Judy'll be all right; she is just cross and
tired. I really can't see why she works so
hard."</p>

<p>Sally May, it may be remarked, would never
work very hard as long as she lived: she wasn't
that kind.</p>

<p>"Did you hear Judith give Jane what-for
the other day?" she continued. "Jane went
into Judy's cubicle with an orange peel and
an old piece of rubber cut in the shape of a
heart, and called out, 'What price for these
personal relics of our beloved Captain Catherine?
Her pretty foot has pressed this piece<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
of rubber; it can be conveniently sewed to the
camisole and worn next the heart. Her pretty
lips once touched this piece of peel'&mdash;and she
dangled the peel right in front of Judy's eyes.
'Get out of my room quick,' said our polite
little Judy, 'and take your garbage with you!'
Jane said it gave her a nasty turn. It's my
belief that Judy wants to come first in history
or something, and she wants to be left alone
to study."</p>

<p>Nancy was only half-convinced, but the
easiest thing was to accept Sally May's explanation.
Nancy had many friends and she was
able to love them all. She found it hard to
understand Judith's exclusive attitude. Judith
wanted but one friend at a time; she might
admire Josephine and Sally May and enjoy
Jane's pertness and Joyce's cleverness and
adore Catherine's beauty, but Nancy was her
friend, her pal, and she wanted Nancy to feel
the same about her. But Nancy was differently
made, and although Judith had come to
be perhaps her best friend in the school, she
was able to feel genuine affection for many
other girls and would have been incapable of
Judith's passionate jealousy because of her
affection for some one else.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile Judith's hurt decreased not at
all. It may take a poet to sing adequately of
"the wounds by friendship made," but a sixteen-year-old
schoolgirl, if she be blessed or
cursed by her fairy godmothers with a sensitive
soul, can feel those wounds and feel them
bitterly.</p>

<p>The after-dinner half-hour of rest had been
a time when the crew of the "Jolly Susan"
had shut their door on the outside world and
had taken their ease. Visiting without permission
at this hour was not usually allowed,
but Catherine was often quite willing that
Judith and Nancy should be in each other's
rooms, for they could talk quite quietly and
made no disturbance. Now Judith could hear
Nancy in Sally's room, and this was more than
she could bear. Instead of coming up to her
room directly after lunch, she asked to have a
practising period put on her time-table from
two to two-thirty, and the odd fifteen minutes
before the two o'clock bell rang, which was legitimate
time for visiting, she was spending
in other girls' rooms; in fact Judith was beginning
to find out that there were other interesting
and lovable girls in the school besides those
select few in the "Jolly Susan."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>There was Rosamond, for instance, whom
Judith had at first regarded with mild contempt
because she was greedy, but Rosamond,
she found out, was aware of her besetting sin
and this Lenten season was disciplining herself
strictly, and no one could be more sympathetic
if one were in trouble than the same Rosamond;
and there was Joyce Hewson whom Judith
had thought proud, but who seemed unapproachable
because she was really shy and very
conscious of her unusual height; and then
there was Florence Newman who had seemed
at the beginning of the term so unresponsive
and dull. Florence and Josephine had become
friends, drawn together by love for their far-away
Western homes, and dropping into Florence's
room one day with Josephine, Judith
had been entranced by the tales of mountain
climbing and hunting which Florence had to
tell. Florence had <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'scarely'">scarcely</ins> seen a girl of her
own age until she dropped suddenly into the
hurly-burly of York Hill, and it was no wonder
that a painful shyness had made her seem
ungracious and almost rude. She simply hadn't
known how to meet the advances of these kind,
jolly girls.</p>

<p>And then there was Miss Ashwell. Miss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Ashwell had slipped on the ice a couple of
months before and had sprained her ankle so
badly that, although she was able now to get
up and down to the studio, she walked slowly
and with a cane. Judith got into the way
of knocking at Miss Ashwell's door after lunch
to see if she could do any errand for her.
Sometimes she carried her books up to the
studio, or ran downstairs to see if there were
any word of the model who was to come for the
two-thirty class, and sometimes she went in and
sat in Miss Ashwell's comfortable chair and
felt rested and happy, for Miss Ashwell seemed
to possess some curious secret of healing.</p>

<p>Judith was a beauty-lover, and if any one
had asked her why she liked Miss Ashwell, she
would probably have replied promptly, "Because
she is so pretty." Miss Ashwell <i>was</i>
pretty, with her clear blue eyes, gold-brown
hair, and a skin so fair and soft, that it made
one think of apple-blossoms; and she had
charm, that indefinable something, which like
a magnet drew others to her.</p>

<p>The week after the miserable dinner-party
was rainy and cold, and something of the grey
dulness out-of-doors seemed to have penetrated
within. For Judith, at least, the mornings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
dragged heavily; everything seemed to
have lost its flavour. At recess she would look
over at Nancy, who seemed to be having a
jolly time with Sally May and Joyce, and
want to join them and laugh, too. There wasn't
any reason in the world why she shouldn't do
so except the nasty little spirit which had taken
possession of her. But she hardened her heart&mdash;and
was quite miserable in consequence.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the week, one day after
lunch she stood hesitating for a moment at the
head of the stairs. Should she go down to
the "Jolly Susan," or visit with Florence or
Miss Ashwell. The thought of Miss Ashwell
was comforting, her room was the "homiest"
place Judith knew, so she tapped at the door
of the pleasant little brown room at the end
of the corridor.</p>

<p>Miss Ashwell was knitting to-day. She was
nearly always knitting for some one else,
thought Judith, as she idly watched the needles
flashing. Knitting made her think of Red
Cross work, and that led straight to the awful
thought of a Current Events test shortly coming
off. While they were to be examined on the
whole term's work, part of the test was the writing
of an essay on a subject chosen from a list<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
of three. Judith had decided to write on "Red
Cross Work in Italy." Her father's brother,
Brian, was a brilliant engineer who had been
loaned to Italy by the British Government,
and Judith naturally knew more about the war
in Italy than anywhere else. She would have
to get Uncle Brian's letters out and piece together
the bits of information he had given
her. She and her father had read several magazine
articles last summer, but she couldn't
even remember what magazines they were.
Oh, dear, what a lot of work it would be! How
tired she was! If she could just stay here and
sleep all afternoon! She heaved a big gusty
sigh. Miss Ashwell looked up quickly.</p>

<p>"What's wrong, Judy, dear?" Miss Ashwell
never seemed to be in a hurry herself, a
miraculous achievement at York Hill. Judith
told her tale of woe, sure of sympathy.</p>

<p>Miss Ashwell seemed even more interested
than usual.</p>

<p>"I believe I can help you, Judy," she said,
her cheeks flushing; "just hand me my despatch-case
from the table." She opened it and
took out snapshots, pictures cut from magazines,
and several descriptive articles dealing
with the subject in hand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>Judith looked her amazement. It seemed
almost too good to be true. Miss Ashwell
smiled and her cheeks grew pinker than ever.</p>

<p>"I'm especially interested in Italian work,
Judy&mdash;because I had a friend out there during
the war. He sent me these snapshots.
I'll show them to you now and you may take
the magazine articles with you. The Red Cross
did such magnificent work there that I don't
wonder Miss Kingston chose that as one of
your subjects."</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Ashwell, it's just like the manna
in the wilderness," gasped Judith,&mdash;"I mean
I'm so grateful," she explained incoherently,
"although the Jews were not always properly
grateful, were they? But I am. I didn't see
<i>how</i> I could hunt up all those references with
all I have to do."</p>

<p>Miss Ashwell showed her the pictures, but
Judith's mind was divided between interest at
the skilful ways in which difficulties of transit
in the mountains had been overcome and interest
in Miss Ashwell. Was it possible that
Miss Ashwell was interested in a soldier-man
the way girls were? Of course, she wasn't so
<i>very</i> old, perhaps twenty-two, and as Judith
ran off with her treasure she kept saying to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
herself, "Wouldn't it be funny&mdash;he looks
awfully nice in the snaps&mdash;she's a perfect
dear, anyway, and I'll get at that Current
Events prep. right away."</p>

<p>Next day Miss Marlowe handed back the
"Jessica" essays to her Five A class in English
composition. Five A looked glum as they
read their marks and the somewhat caustic
comments written in their exercise books. Judith
flushed as she read: "Neatly and carefully
written, Judith, but hardly interesting. You
were not asked to give a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the play,
but a character sketch of Jessica. What do you
know about Jessica now that you didn't know
before you wrote your essay? How have you
enlarged your knowledge of human nature?"</p>

<p>How, indeed? Judith felt distinctly aggrieved.
What impossibly hard things Miss
Marlowe expected them to do! She had
worked hard over that essay and had looked
for a little praise, but instead here was Miss
Marlowe thumping the desk and telling them
they never used their brains. Five A sat at
attention. Miss Marlowe, indignant, was apt
to be interesting, but no one desired to be the
luckless offender against whom her Irish wit
might be directed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>She gave them a lively two minutes on the
foolishness of not using the brains they had,
and then came down to the subject in hand.</p>

<p>"You didn't try to <i>understand</i> Jessica; you
knew that her conduct was unfilial, to say the
least, and don't imagine that I am forgetting
the wrong things she did, or that I want you
to approve of her. I <i>don't</i>, but I do want you
to try to understand. That's just the reason
why you were assigned this lesson. Only one
of you made the effort to re-create Shylock's
home. Read your essay, Florence, please."</p>

<p>The class looked surprised as Florence,
white with shyness, began to read, falteringly
at first and then more convincingly. Every
one, with the exception perhaps of Judith, was
surprised at the excellence of the essay. Florence
Newman, that quiet, shy, stiff, little thing!
They had expected that Joyce or Phyllis or
Judith, or even Frances, would be held up to
them as models, but not Florence.</p>

<p>"Run down to the common room, Nancy.
You're nearest the door; and bring me Lamb's
'Life and Letters,' a big red book lying on
my table." And then, turning to the class,
"Now, never mind about Jessica, though I
hope you see the difference between your way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
of approach and Florence's, but remember
this, it's far, far easier to criticize, to judge, and
to condemn, than it is to sympathize and to
understand; it's the little people of the world
who do the judging; it's the big people who
do the understanding.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Nancy. Now listen to the
words of a wise woman, Mary Lamb. What
do you know about Mary Lamb, Frances?
Yes, she wrote many of the 'Tales from Shakespeare,'
and she lived with her brother Charles
and was his greatest friend, and the friend of
his friends. She is writing to a friend of hers
who has been confessing to actions which Mary
might just as easily have condemned as you
condemned Jessica's. But this is what she
writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>You will smile when I tell you I think myself the only
woman in the world who could live with a brother's wife
and make a real friend of her&mdash;partly from a knack I
know I have of looking into people's real characters and
never expecting them to act out of it. Never expecting
another to do as I would in the same case. I do not expect
you or want you to be otherwise than you are. I love
you for the good that is in you.</p></div>

<p>"There's wisdom," concluded Miss Marlowe,
"and next time you find yourselves saying,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
'<i>I</i> wouldn't have been so mean or horrid
or selfish,' just ask yourself, how do you know
you wouldn't, and what has that got to do
with it, and what do you know about it, anyway?
Are you showing sympathetic insight
or merely conceit? You'll meet plenty of
Jessicas who are easier to condemn than to
understand. Don't lose your friends by a
lack of loving understanding. Be grateful for
them; they are your most precious possessions.
Love them for the best that is in them.</p>

<p>"There, that's a longer sermon than usual.
Take your pens now and write that sentence
from Mary Lamb's letter at the bottom of
your essay, and after I have dictated it make
your corrections and jot down the new things
about Jessica that you haven't noted before."</p>

<p>Five A heaved a sigh of relief. Miss Marlowe
was through with them once more. There
was the usual clattering of inkwells and requests
for new pens, and then Miss Marlowe
went to her desk, and according to custom one
by one the class brought up their books to
receive her suggestions and criticisms.</p>

<p>Judith wrote her corrections mechanically
and slowly, but her mind was working swiftly.
That's what she had been doing, judging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Nancy, saying, '<i>I</i> wouldn't have done it';
criticizing, not trying to understand, and she
had judged herself, condemned herself to do
without Nancy and the precious possession of
Nancy's friendship. Darling Nancy! She
might have been loving her all this time for
the good in her, her sweetness, her unfailing
kindness, her absolute squareness, her dearness.</p>

<p>Judith's eyes were shining as she carried up
her book to Miss Marlowe, and the fervency
with which she said, "Thank you," when Miss
Marlowe had finished her criticism, brought a
happy smile to Miss Marlowe's own eyes.</p>

<p>"That child's got the idea," she said to herself;
"Well, if <i>one</i> seed falls into good ground
it's worth while&mdash;splendidly worth while."</p>

<p>The recess bell rang and Five A lost no time
filing out to the corridor and thence to tuck
shop and gymnasium, but Judith was delayed
by her duties as monitress and Nancy was not
to be seen when she reached the corridor.
Down to the tuck shop sped Judith.</p>

<p>"Seen Nancy?" she asked Jane who was
rapidly consuming two large buns and an ice-cream
cone.</p>

<p>"Gone up to her room, I think," said Jane.</p>

<p>Upstairs fled Judith without waiting for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
permission and found Nancy just leaving the
"Jolly Susan."</p>

<p>"Oh, Nancy, I have been hunting for you
everywhere."</p>

<p>"Oh, Judy, I was just looking for you.
After what Miss Marlowe said&mdash;about our
friends&mdash;I didn't want to wait another minute
feeling that you were still angry with me.
Do tell me what I did and let me tell you how
sorry I am."</p>

<p>"And I was looking for you, Nancy, dear&mdash;to
tell you how horrid I'd been. It was just
a little thing not worth mentioning now, but
I didn't wait to try to understand. Oh,
Nancy, I've missed you so!"</p>

<p>And they kissed and were friends.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't teach English composition for
all the world," said Miss Hilton, eyeing the big
pile of sixth-form books which Miss Marlowe
was attacking late that evening.</p>

<p>"And <i>I</i> wouldn't take all the world <i>not</i> to
teach English composition," retorted Miss
Marlowe proudly. "Besides," she added with
true Irish lucidity, "it isn't English composition
I'm teaching. It's Life, and it's the biggest
job in the world."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>EASTER HOLIDAYS</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> last two weeks of the Easter term were
a long and a hard pull. Some of the girls were
spurred to study by a remembrance of the reception
of the Christmas report at home;
father's sarcastic remarks, and mother's distress.
In Five A, which was considered a
good working form, competition was very
keen, and most of the form were putting forth
their best efforts to stand high in the term's
examination lists. Judith coveted a first place
in English literature, partly because of the
joy of triumphing, partly because of the pleasure
her success would give her parents, and
partly because she wanted to show Miss Marlowe
how much she had appreciated her classes.</p>

<p>This term-end there was no distracting play
to interfere with studying, and Judith had a
chance to do her best. She tried to look unconcerned
when on breaking-up day Form
Five A stood up in Big Hall while Miss
Meredith read their general proficiency list.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
"First, Joyce Hewson; Second, Judith Benson."
There was such a buzzing in Judith's
ears that she didn't hear the next few names.
Second! Wouldn't Daddy be pleased! Nancy
squeezed her hand. Dear Nancy! and she
wasn't even listening to hear where Nancy
was placed. "Tenth, Nancy Nairn," read
Miss Meredith.</p>

<p>"Bully for you and pretty good for me,"
said Nancy when they had led out of Hall.</p>

<p>"Congrats., Judy," said Phyllis heartily.
"Joyce had better watch out next term."</p>

<p>Judith glowed&mdash;fancy being ahead of
Phyllis. There was a crowd around the bulletin
board: "The subject lists," said Phyllis excitedly,
and she and Judith fairly ran down
the corridor and eagerly scanned the board.
"Five A, English Literature, 1. Judith Benson,
Phyllis Lovell, equal. 2. Joyce Hewson."
No need to congratulate each other, but you
may be sure they did.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> nice to get what one wants," philosophized
a very happy Judith as she finished
packing her suitcase. "I wonder if anything
is nicer."</p>

<p>Aunt Nell had sent her a little note the day
before telling her to ask several of the girls to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
tea who were staying in school for the holidays.
"The first afternoon is a horrid time for the
girls who are left in," she wrote; "perhaps
we can save a few of them from homesickness.
I'll come for you in the car at two-thirty."</p>

<p>Judith had a delightful time choosing her
guests; Josephine and Sally May, of course&mdash;Nancy
had gone home&mdash;and Florence and
Joyce; but what about Genevieve Singleton?
Judith knew that Genevieve was disappointed
about an expected invitation for Easter week,
for she had been loud in her lamentations.
"I'd better ask her," thought Judith; "she
doesn't know that I played detective, and
she's sure to feel badly when she sees the others
going; her pride'll be hurt."</p>

<p>So Genevieve was invited, and it was a merry
little party that gathered in the front hall.
They weren't going very far, to be sure, but
they were going away anyhow, if it was only
for the afternoon. Aunt Nell took them for
a run through the park and out into the country
before they went home for tea.</p>

<p>They had a jolly tea-party; Aunt Nell
poured tea for them, supplied them with plenty
of toast and muffins, sandwiches and cake, and
then very soon vanished.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>"I knew they would talk more freely if I
were not there," she said afterwards to Judith,
"and unless things have changed very much
since I was at York, I can give a pretty good
guess as to what you talked about. Confess
now," as Judith blushed a little under Aunt
Nell's laughing quizzical eyes, "didn't you
discuss every teacher on the staff from the cut
of her Sunday coat to the cut of her Monday
temper? Of course you did."</p>

<p>And of course they had. Genevieve convulsed
them by a dramatic representation of a
stormy scene between herself and Madame
Philippe; then Miss Evans's new evening
frock, Miss Marlowe's incomprehensible taste
in preferring Jane Austen to Dickens, Miss
Langton's terrifying sarcasm, Miss Ashwell's
sweet new sweater coat, all were discussed
with an enormous amount of interest and delight.</p>

<p>Next day life was "flat, stale, and unprofitable."
Judith didn't realize how tired she
was; mentally and emotionally she had been
keyed up to a very high pitch during the last
two or three months and now had come the
inevitable reaction. No wonder she was dull
and miserable. But next morning the sun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
was shining brightly, there was a fresh, clean-washed
feeling in the air, and as Judith stood
at the open casement window in the dining-room
waiting for the others to come down to
breakfast, she saw to her joy that the maple
trees in the garden were beginning to put out
their tiny red flowers. Was spring really coming
after all this dismal weather? Judith's
spirits went up with a bound. Oh, if summer
were only here and one could stay out-of-doors!</p>

<p>The others came in to breakfast; Uncle Tom
buried himself in his newspaper and ate at intervals;
Doris, as pretty as a picture in her
pink gingham frock, began a long monologue
about a dolls' tea-party she had had in a dream
last night; Bobby busied himself with his
porridge; Aunt Nell cooked the eggs in a
little electric grill; and Judith found she had
plenty to do attending to the electric toaster
and her porridge at the same time. Usually
Lizzie brought in a plate of hot toast and then
some one at the table made additional pieces
on the toaster, but this morning there was no
supply to begin with.</p>

<p>Judith chatted happily about the plans for
the week: Aunt Nell mustn't forget that she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
had promised to take her to do her spring
shopping; Daddy had sent a cheque; she did
hope there would be a letter from Nancy this
morning saying that she could come for the
last week-end; and did Aunt Nell remember,
too, that she had invited Miss Ashwell for
dinner on Thursday? Judith noticed that
Aunt Nell's smile was somewhat forced.
Was anything wrong? Didn't Aunt Nell
want Nancy, after all? How dreadful! She
would have to ask her after breakfast.</p>

<p>Uncle Tom finished his breakfast with a rush
and then, gathering up letters and papers,
made for the hall. Aunt Nell, Bobby, and
Doris were kissed good-bye, and he was gone
with a great banging of doors.</p>

<p>Aunt Nell came back rather slowly into the
dining-room, folded up Uncle Tom's table napkin,
pushed back Bobby's chair and then said
tersely, "Lizzie has gone."</p>

<p>"Gone!" said Judith stupidly; "gone where?"</p>

<p>"I don't know that I care very much where,"
said Aunt Nell; "the point is that she has gone.
She gave me notice a week ago, and I've been
trying desperately hard ever since to get some
one else, but I've had no answers to advertisements.
Lizzie just sent a note saying that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
she had decided to get married at once and
that she and 'her friend' had gone to Buffalo
for the holiday and she wouldn't be coming
back here. I did think she'd stay her month,
at least, after all the time she's been here&mdash;but
I suppose he had a holiday and overpersuaded
her. I don't feel that virtue has been
rewarded either," she added ruefully, "for if
I hadn't given her all of Easter Monday for
herself she might be here to wash the breakfast
dishes, instead of which you and I must
do them."</p>

<p>"Instead of which <i>I'll</i> do them Aunt Nell,"
Judith said laughingly. "Dishes aren't anything.
Come on, Doris, let's see how quickly
we can do them. Don't worry, Aunt Nell.
I'm not Lizzie, of course, but I'm just spoiling
for something to do." And she gave Aunt
Nell a reassuring hug and kiss.</p>

<p>"You're a little brick, Judy&mdash;of course
we'll manage. I'll 'phone for Mrs. Webster
to come this morning instead of this afternoon
to look after Hugh, and then you and I can
do the rest."</p>

<p>But alack! Mrs. Webster's sister answered
the 'phone&mdash;she was very sorry, her sister was
in bed with tonsillitis and she had just sent for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
the doctor&mdash;it would be a week or two, anyway,
before she could come back to look after
the baby.</p>

<p>Here was news, indeed&mdash;Bobby and Hugh
were work enough for one person at any time.
Baby Hugh had a cold, and was cross and
fretful because a certain tooth was reluctant
about making its first appearance.</p>

<p>They had a busy day. Aunt Nell went out
in the afternoon to try her luck at various
employment agencies and Judith took the
children for a walk. She rather enjoyed it
at first, but after three-year-old Bobby had
demanded the repetition of the story of "The
Three Bears" for the sixth time, and had
fiercely resented the changing of a phrase with
"Dat's not in the tory," Judith began to feel
tired and cross.</p>

<p>Doris was very little trouble, for she was,
as usual, entirely engrossed in an endless game
of her own invention. She furnished each
house they passed with a large family and
gave every member a name and occupation:
thus the big white house at the corner where
Judge Wilton lived was peopled in Doris's
imagination with Mr. and Mrs. Black and
their eight children, Mary and Martha, Robert<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
and Thomas, Geoffrey and Susan, Billy and
Minnie. Judith could hear her describing
them. "Mary is a cook, she writes nice letters
and makes lemon pies; Martha is a nice girl,
she has yellow hair and blue eyes; Robert is
tall and strong, he is a coachman and squints
with his left eye"; and so on and so on. A few
families of this size absorbed Doris's attention
for hours at a time.</p>

<p>Judith took most comfort out of Baby
Hugh; he was so sweet and so kissable, his
eyes so blue and his cheeks so like wild roses
that sometimes Judith felt that she would just
have to take a little bite out of the adorable
crease at the back of his neck.</p>

<p>The first of the precious two holiday weeks
was gone before either Aunt Nell or Judith
had accomplished any of the things they had
meant to do, and the good times, especially
Nancy's visit, which Judith had looked forward
to with such pleasure, seemed to have vanished
into thin air.</p>

<p>There was no doubt that Aunt Nell needed
her, for there was endless dusting and dishwashing
to do, and some one always had to be
with the children.</p>

<p>Judith was making gravy one evening&mdash;a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
task she detested&mdash;when Uncle Tom came
into the kitchen looking particularly pleased
with himself.</p>

<p>"You're late, dear," was Aunt Nell's greeting;
"please hurry; I haven't had time to give
Bobby his supper, he'll have to have it with
us, and I'm afraid Baby isn't asleep yet."</p>

<p>"Hurrah, hurrah!" said Uncle Tom&mdash;very
irrelevantly, Judith thought indignantly;
gravy-making time was no occasion for being
funny, but Uncle Tom was like that, you never
knew.</p>

<p>"It takes a man to tackle a job," said Uncle
Tom complacently as he carved the roast&mdash;"you
wouldn't let me wait to tell you some
good news I had brought home. Perhaps
we'd better wait now until dinner is over,"
he continued. But of course he couldn't wait&mdash;modesty
was not Uncle Tom's strong point.
"Well, if you must know, as I said it takes
a man to tackle a job. I just mentioned
to Stewart that we were in a fix, couldn't
get a cook for love or money. 'This time for
love and money you can,' said Stewart. 'My
wife and I are going down to Bermuda to-morrow
and we didn't quite know what to do
with our Chinese boy&mdash;Mrs. S. had promised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
to lend him to her sister, and quite suddenly
her sister decided to go with us.' So there you
are," finished Uncle Tom superbly&mdash;"he arrives
to-morrow, tip-top cook, takes complete
charge of kitchen arrangements. Not bad, eh?"</p>

<p>Not bad! Aunt Nell almost wept for joy.
If it hadn't been that she had had to spend so
much time hunting for help, the housekeeping
would have been nothing, she declared stoutly
to Uncle Tom later, with her head tucked
under his chin. She did weep a tear or two
into his favorite tie. "Judith has been splendid,
and of course we could have managed
perfectly; it was the time I spent going from
one bureau to another and following up this
trail and the other that has tired us both."</p>

<p>"Strikes me," said Uncle Tom, "that Judy
couldn't have tackled the pots and pans last
year the way she does now."</p>

<p>"Of course she couldn't," said Aunt Nell,
trying vainly to repair the damages Uncle
Tom had done to her hair in his desire to show
his sympathy&mdash;he inevitably wound the loose
strands of her hair tightly around her ears.
"Judy has had to tackle all sorts of things
this year, more things than she ever dreamed
of, and she's caught the York Hill spirit of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
putting through any sort of job that her hands
find to do."</p>

<p>"Look here," said Uncle Tom, "wait until
I get settled on the Chesterfield before we
begin on York Hill. I often wonder how I
manage to get on at the office without having
had the inestimable privilege of being trained
at York Hill Ladies' Academy!"</p>

<p>Yip arrived next morning at the promised
time&mdash;it seemed too good to be true&mdash;bland,
smiling, competent, and one of the first things
Aunt Nell did was to send a telegram to Nancy
inviting her to come just as soon as her mother
would spare her. The answer came almost
before Aunt Nell and Judith had finished
planning their shopping expedition for the
next day&mdash;Mrs. Nairn and Nancy were coming
up to Toronto for a week's visit with
some relatives from Boston who were passing
through on their way to Vancouver, and Nancy
"accepted with pleasure" for the last few
days of the holidays.</p>

<p>Judith had a happy day buying her spring
"trousseau"&mdash;Nancy had cautioned her to
lay in a goodly supply of white skirts and middies
for the "sports" term&mdash;and then came the
looked-for morning when she waited for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Montreal express that was to bring her this
best friend&mdash;whom she hadn't met a short
seven months before and whom now she was
sure she couldn't live without!</p>

<p>Seven months ago! Was it really less than
a year ago that she herself had come into this
very station feeling a little bit frightened of
the new life at York Hill? Judith smiled
happily. How different things were now&mdash;but
that must be the train. Her heart beat
quickly as she scanned the faces of the incoming
travellers. Yes, there was Mrs. Nairn
and there was Nancy's adorable little self.
Oh, how good it was to see her again!</p>

<p>Breakfast over and Mrs. Nairn escorted to
her cousins' hotel, the two chums settled down
to a long morning's gossip. So many things
can take place in two weeks! Judith had to
hear every single thing that had happened to
Nancy since they parted, and Nancy, every
single thing that had happened to Judith.</p>

<p>"Jack thinks that is one of the funniest things
about girls' friendships," observed Nancy
after she had received a very full account
of the two weeks' doings, "our wanting to
know <i>everything</i> about our friends; he thinks
it's awfully queer, but I think it's queer not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
to. Why, when he and Tom meet on Monday
he'll say, 'Hello, Tom;' and Tom will say,
'Hello, Jack,' and then they'll begin talking
about the state of the cricket crease very
likely."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 273px;">
<img src="images/gs03.jpg" width="273" height="400" alt="JUDITH HAD TO HEAR EVERY SINGLE THING THAT HAD HAPPENED TO NANCY SINCE THEY PARTED" title="JUDITH HAD TO HEAR EVERY SINGLE THING THAT HAD HAPPENED TO NANCY SINCE THEY PARTED" />
<span class="caption">JUDITH HAD TO HEAR EVERY SINGLE THING THAT HAD HAPPENED TO NANCY SINCE THEY PARTED</span>
</div>

<p>Nancy was very full of all the delightful
events of next term; there would be the Cup
Matches first of all, and the teams of the various
houses were discussed "up and down
and round and about"; then would come
Field Day. "I'm not sure," said Nancy,
"just which is the nicest day of all at school;
sometimes I think it's the day of the Reunion
suppers when the Old Girls come back, or
Prize-giving Day, or the day of the final Cup
Match, and then when Field Day comes I'm
perfectly certain it's the best of all."</p>

<p>Then there was the Reunion play to discuss;
it was to be "Pride and Prejudice" this year
and Judith had been reading the story during
the holidays. Would Catherine be the heroine
or would Eleanor be chosen, and what about
Genevieve for one of the other parts? She
would make a good Mrs. Bennet. Of course
she could act splendidly, but still&mdash;Judith expressed
her astonishment at Genevieve's returning
popularity. "After what she did I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
don't see how some of the girls can admire her
so much," she said to Nancy.</p>

<p>"But popularity's queer, anyhow," said
Nancy; "look at Rosamond Fraser. I suppose
some people would say that Rosamond
was one of the most popular girls in the house,
and we know it's because she always has such
good 'eats' to give away. And then there's
Eleanor, we know she's popular because she
is such a brick. There ought to be another
word for <i>her</i> kind of popularity. Genevieve
is clever, you know, and she's awfully funny,"
she continued, smiling as she remembered
Genevieve mimicking Miss Langton in a temper;
"anybody who is amusing can be popular,"
she concluded sagely.</p>

<p>Judith was impressed with Nancy's wisdom.
"Well, but&mdash;Miss Ashwell and Miss Marlowe
are popular, too, aren't they?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Nancy; "but it's not the same
kind of popularity as Miss Morton's. Miss
Morton is like Rosamond; the West House
girls say you can always get a special permission
from her if you're sweet enough to her.
She positively likes 'slush.'"</p>

<p>"And Miss Marlowe is like Eleanor," assented
Judith thoughtfully. "Nancy, which do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
you like the best, Miss Ashwell or Miss Marlowe?"</p>

<p>But this was a question not to be easily
settled; they spent a most enjoyable though
perhaps not highly profitable morning discussing
this and various other items of burning
interest; they loved to gossip, as all schoolgirls&mdash;and
most of the rest of us&mdash;do, but it
was harmless enough and never unkind.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Aunt Nell, apparently, was determined that
Judith should have a gay week-end, for after
luncheon she warned them that this was to be
their last quiet morning. Yip, it seemed, was
so proud of his skill in concocting wonderful
salads and ices, that he had no objection to
company&mdash;and Judith was to invite any one
she liked for dinner to-morrow, and they were
to lunch with Mrs. Nairn downtown and go to
a matinee, and Aunt Nell would be delighted to
give them a tea-party the day before school
opened.</p>

<p>They had the jolliest time possible; Judith
loved playing hostess, and carte-blanche for a
dinner and a tea-party was a great treat; and
to have Nancy to discuss everything with&mdash;"just
bliss" Judith confided to Aunt Nell.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>And if holidays <i>will</i> end, it wasn't hard to
go back to the "Jolly Susan" and look forward
to the good times which were promised
in "the best term of all."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>THE MESSENGER</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Come</span> on, do, Nancy," urged Judith; "it's
on Friday, there is nothing else doing and it's
sure to be interesting, for there are to be pictures
of the work in Italy and in Russia.
Miss Ashwell's going to take us. I'm going
to be her partner," she added importantly.</p>

<p>"Well, that settles it," said Nancy; "you
and your Miss Ashwell! I won't go if I can't
go with you. It's a long walk from the University
to the cars and I'm tired of Red Cross,
anyway."</p>

<p>Judith and Jane were curled up on Nancy's
couch eating chocolates; Nancy had just had
a birthday and Jack had sent her a gratifyingly
large box of candy with the injunction
to go "fifty-fifty" with Judith and thus save
herself from a bilious attack.</p>

<p>"I can't see why you are so keen on another
Red Cross meeting, Judy. I should think
you'd be tired of the subject after writing that
long essay for Miss Kingston&mdash;but I forgot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
about your Uncle Brian.&mdash;Get off my foot,
Jane, do."</p>

<p>Jane selected another chocolate, and said
with a chuckle:</p>

<p>"You should have been in our French division
this morning! <i>Dear</i> Miss Watson, how
she hates me."</p>

<p>"I don't wonder," said Catherine, who was
on the window-seat mending a lace ruffle.
"Don't tell me that you've been tormenting
her again."</p>

<p>"Certainly; we always do at the beginning
of term, though we get tired of it after a while.
We had verbs this morning with lots of <i>r's</i> in
them&mdash;accourir and servir and reconna&icirc;tre&mdash;so
I winked to Althea and Maggie and we had
a dandy time. It saves lots of work," she
added reflectively. "Every time Miss Watson
rolled an <i>r</i>, one of us put up a hand and
asked to have the word repeated. We just
couldn't understand her. We made it last
for most of the period, and the poor dear
didn't get to the exercise at all."</p>

<p>"I'd have sent you packing, the whole lot
of you, to Miss Meredith. You deserve it,
and then I guess you'd be sorry, you little
worms!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, would you?" retorted Jane shrewdly;
"not if you had reported us all two days ago
for setting a metronome going in class. That
<i>was</i> fun! Miss Meredith is getting tired of
Miss Watson's returned lessons and bad marks,
though she gave us a jolly good scolding, I
must say. No, I think we are pretty safe for
this week." And she chuckled reminiscently.</p>

<p>"Choose some one your own size, Jane,"
suggested Catherine, hunting for a piece of
chocolate ginger; "'t isn't sporting to pick on
Miss Watson like that."</p>

<p>"Well, why not?" demanded Jane. "She
isn't on her job&mdash;she's just plain stupid&mdash;I
don't believe she ever thinks about anything."</p>

<p>"Well, you're wrong there&mdash;she's just
crazy about reading&mdash;she reads everything&mdash;her
room is full of books, and Miss Ashwell
says she knows more about Russian literature
than most people in this country. None of you
children been bothering Miss Ashwell, have
you?"</p>

<p>There was an indignant denial, and Judith,
remembering that she had seen her friend and
comforter looking very much as if she herself
stood in need of comforting, asked quickly:</p>

<p>"Why do you ask, Cathy?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, well, she seems bothered," was the
rather vague answer.</p>

<p>Judith ran down to Miss Ashwell's room at
visiting time that night, and tapping at the
door put in her head and enquired, "May I
come in?"</p>

<p>"Not just now, Judith," said Miss Ashwell,
"I'm busy."</p>

<p>Judith with a mumbled apology disappeared
at once, but not before she had seen that Miss
Ashwell's busy-ness had to do apparently with
the snapshot of a handsome soldier propped
against the reading-lamp&mdash;a despatch case
lay open on the floor beside her and there
were letters strewn over the table and in Miss
Ashwell's lap.</p>

<p>"Now, wasn't that too bad of me to rush in
like that," thought Judith, as she hurried away.
"I wonder if that's the picture she showed me
the other day&mdash;she was probably going to
write to him&mdash;wouldn't it be exciting?"</p>

<p>Miss Ashwell looked complacently next day
at her line of forty girls as they were ushered
into reserved seats near the front of Convocation
Hall. They might some of them look like
young hoydens in middy blouses and gymnasium
bloomers&mdash;which costume most of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
them affected during school hours&mdash;but now,
in their trim serge suits and <i>chic</i> little hats,
they were a credit to their chaperon, and as
it was considered bad form to misbehave "in
line" at church or concert or lecture, Miss
Ashwell settled down and gave herself up to
the luxury of her own thoughts.</p>

<p>Judith, sitting beside her and looking eagerly
at the portraits of founders and benefactors,
decided that they could not be very happy
thoughts, for she heard one soft little sigh and
then another. Miss Ashwell was unhappy
again! Something pathetic about the droop
of her lips made Judith feel sudden anger
against the unknown cause of Miss Ashwell's
melancholy. It might, of course, have been a
large millinery bill, or indigestion, or a blouse
that wouldn't fit, but Judith's romantic soul
would have none of these. It must be that man
in the Italian snapshots. How pretty Miss
Ashwell had looked that day when she had
showed Judith the Italian pictures! How her
eyes had deepened until they were almost violet,
and how her cheeks had glowed! Perhaps he
was an unfaithful lover, perhaps he had married
an Italian girl, or even a German in a
sudden impulse of pity, and now could not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
come home to Canada to face his old love. No,
not married, just betrothed, because of course
he must come home, and Judith was already
staging Miss Ashwell's wedding when the
President and faculty members, together with
distinguished guests and officials of the Red
Cross Society, took their places on the dais.</p>

<p>Judith leaned forward eagerly. How
delightfully the red and blue splashes of colour
of the professors' <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'acadamic'">academic</ins> hoods showed up
against the old-oak panelling. That must be
an Oxford hood, and there was an Edinburgh
one. Daddy had showed her one like that&mdash;but
the President was speaking. He regretted
that Dr. Johnson, who was to have lectured
this afternoon, was unavoidably absent through
illness, but a distinguished graduate of their
own, who had been with the Intelligence Staff
in Italy and had won the Military Cross because
of a particularly brilliant piece of work
there, who had been a prisoner in Russia for
nearly a year, and who had recently been engaged
in relief work in Serbia, had been prevailed
upon to take Dr. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Johnston's'">Johnson's</ins> place. He
had much pleasure in introducing Major David
Phillips.</p>

<p>The York Hill line bent forward eagerly&mdash;an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
M.C.&mdash;a Russian prisoner&mdash;name David&mdash;David
was a favourite name just then&mdash;one
of their own University boys, wounded, tall,
thin, dark hair turning grey at the temples in
the most approved fashion! How satisfactorily
romantic!</p>

<p>But just how romantic, not one of the forty
guessed but Judith. She alone heard the quick
intake of Miss Ashwell's breath, she alone
saw the flood of colour sweep over Miss Ashwell's
face, she could almost hear the thumpings
of Miss Ashwell's heart, and Judith
guessed at once that the here who was being
enthusiastically applauded was the hero of the
Italian snapshots, and Miss Ashwell's face was
sufficient confirmation. How thrilling, how
wonderful! He was home again, Miss Ashwell
would be happy, everybody would be happy!
Probably they would be married right away&mdash;she
had forgotten the imaginary German
bride&mdash;and maybe Miss Ashwell would let her
help her in her shopping. She could go down
on Saturday mornings. Aunt Nell knew an
awfully good shop for linens, an Irish shop.</p>

<p>"Say, Judy," whispered Frances, "isn't
that your Uncle Tom in the back row on the
platform?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, it was. Judith blushed with vexation.
Why couldn't Uncle Tom be more careful?
His tie had slipped its moorings and was
gradually working its way to the top of his
collar. Really, relations ought to be less conspicuous
unless they could be more presentable; she
hoped Catherine wouldn't see him. He did
look ridiculous. Whatever had he done to his
hair? It looked as if he had gone to sleep in
it, thought Judy indignantly.</p>

<p>Judith stole another glance at Miss Ashwell;
the colour had faded and her face was white;
it looked almost stern. Whatever was the
matter? The lights went off for the lantern
slides and Judith, greatly daring, whispered:</p>

<p>"Isn't that the Major Phillips you used to
know, Miss Ashwell? The one who was with
Uncle Brian in Italy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I used to know him, Judith, a long
time ago," in stiff, cold, dignified tones.</p>

<p>Judith felt dazed for a moment; then a
happy inspiration came to her; a lovers' quarrel&mdash;that's
what's the matter. Now, if
they could just meet again without either of
them having to give in, they would be sure to
make it up.</p>

<p>It was very trying having no one to talk to.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
She wished fervently that Nancy or Sally May
or Josephine or Joyce or some one other than
Frances were beside her; she must think hard.
Miss Ashwell was in love with Major Phillips,
that was clear. Major Phillips must be in
love with Miss Ashwell, that went without saying.
Miss Ashwell was unhappy. Of course
it wasn't her business at all, at all, but Judith
didn't think of that. There was something
appealing about Miss Ashwell at all times,
and Miss Ashwell in trouble made Judith certain
that something must be done. She hardly
heard a word the lecturer said, but sat frowning,
thinking hard; then her face cleared; she
had a plan. She would make a dash for the
platform and Uncle Tom the minute the last
picture was put on the screen, and beg him to
introduce her to Major Phillips, and she would
ask him if he would speak at the Arts and
Letters Club, for she knew they wanted some
one for next week. Probably Miss Ashwell
would be very much annoyed and would come
after her, and then&mdash;further than that Judith
didn't go, for she was immediately involved
in the difficulties of how to get away from Miss
Ashwell in order to make her dash for the
platform. The York Hill girls would wait,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
of course, a few minutes until some of the
people had gone before they tried to leave the
building; perhaps by that time Major Phillips
would have disappeared. Judith was still
struggling to think of something plausible to
say to Miss Ashwell when the lights came on
again; and when the organist began "God
Save the King" and the audience rose, Judith
knew that she must act quickly if she were to
to save the situation. Her heart thumped so
loudly that there was a buzzing in her ears and
her hands were icy cold. Miss Ashwell would
be angry; she might even report Judith to Miss
Meredith; Judith quailed at the thought; the
last note sounded.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Miss Ashwell, but there's
Uncle Tom. I simply <i>must</i> speak to him."
And before an astonished and, it must be confessed,
a dreaming Miss Ashwell could say
yea or nay, Judith had slipped past her
down the aisle and was making her way to
the platform. The line was transfixed with
horror.</p>

<p>"Judith Benson! Who does she think she
is, anyway, going right up there amongst all
those 'brass hats?' Is she crazy?"</p>

<p>Judith was lost to York Hill eyes as she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
disappeared into the group of people at the
back of the platform, who were apparently
waiting to have a word with the speaker. She
clutched Uncle Tom's arm with both hands,
and if the warmth of her greeting astonished
him he made no sign.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, I know him," he replied in answer
to her eager questioning. "What you
doin' here by yourself? Oh, are they?"&mdash;and
he turned to get a view of the line. "Arts
and Letters Club, eh? Sounds frightening.
I don't know whether he'd dare." This in
Uncle Tom's facetious manner. "Hey, Phillips"&mdash;to
the hero who was making a determined
effort to escape his questioners&mdash;"Here's
a young lady who is a hero-worshipper."
And as he made the necessary introduction,
he added, to Judith's huge disgust, "She
wants your autograph or something."</p>

<p>Judith made her request politely and, as
with sinking heart she saw that he was going
to refuse, she added clearly, "Miss Elizabeth
Ashwell is waiting down there for us with the
others&mdash;the line I mean." Judith was thrilled
at the change in Major Phillips's face.</p>

<p>"Oh, then, you are Miss Ashwell's messenger,"
he said eagerly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not exactly," stammered Judith; "but
she's waiting for us," she repeated firmly.</p>

<p>Major Phillips lost no time.</p>

<p>"In that case we had better go, not keep a
lady waiting, eh, Mr. Hilton? Perhaps I
ought to say forty ladies," he continued as they
made their way down the aisle.</p>

<p>Judith's knees were trembling. She didn't
dare lift her eyes, as Uncle Tom greeted Miss
Ashwell and she heard him say,</p>

<p>"Major Phillips I believe you know already."</p>

<p>Major Phillips had Miss Ashwell's hand in
his and was clearly paying no attention to
Uncle Tom. The line was divided afterwards
as to whether he shook her hand eagerly or
just held it. The majority favoured the latter
opinion, but all agreed that he looked
right into her eyes and that his voice was
"as different as anything from what it was
before."</p>

<p>Somehow or other they started on their
homeward way with Miss Ashwell and Major
Phillips bringing up the rear, for Williams
the janitor had magically appeared with the
latter's stick, and Uncle Tom thoughtfully
made his adieus and departed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>If Major David Phillips hadn't been too
ecstatically happy to notice anything except
the curve of Miss Ashwell's pink cheek and
the length of her eyelashes and a soft little curl
which hung in front of her ear, he might have
been surprised at the extreme quiet of the
forty girls in front of him; they might have
been walking to a funeral. What he wouldn't
have guessed was that every ear in the line
was stretched backwards to catch his slightest
word or he might have lowered his voice.
As it was at least half the line could hear
him:</p>

<p>Yes, he was glad to be back in Canada.</p>

<p>Yes, two months ago.</p>

<p>He'd been delayed in England over the
Serbian work.</p>

<p>No, he wasn't in town. He had a cottage,
really a little old farmhouse, about ten miles
out of the city. His Aunt Joan had died
while he was away and had left him "White
Cottage." He was living there with his batman,
who was awfully handy and did the cooking
and everything, and between them they
had turned the parlour and the spare bedroom
into a studio. They had made a great northern
window and Jennings was now building a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
piazza. Elizabeth must come and see it. However,
she would have to come soon, as he was
going to France in June.</p>

<p>"Elizabeth," said the line to itself, "and
she didn't call him David?" They felt they
wouldn't have been so behind-hand.</p>

<p>Judith meanwhile, being partnerless, had
wormed her way down to the prefects who
were leading the line.</p>

<p>"Cathy," she whispered urgently, "do go
slow, please; he's limping, you know, and don't
stop when we get to the cars. Please, please,
just walk on slowly, and perhaps Miss Ashwell
won't notice. I'll tell you why later. It's awfully
important."</p>

<p>"Right you are, Mr. First Mate," answered
Catherine, and Judith, not without some whispered
chaffing, got back within earshot.</p>

<p>Major Phillips was talking about his experiences
in the Russian prison and Judy
needn't have worried lest Miss Ashwell should
notice when they reached the cars; Miss Ashwell
was in another world entirely; the line
did not exist for her. They walked on and on
and Major Phillips's voice became lower. The
line began to feel rebellious.</p>

<p>"Fourteen blocks," said Frances Purdy to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
her neighbour. "I'm nearly dead. I shouldn't
wonder if we had to walk all the way."</p>

<p>And they did. Miss Ashwell didn't "notice"
till they began the ascent of the hill and Major
Phillips was obliged to go very slowly, indeed.
Miss Ashwell was full of remorse. His leg
must be hurting, but the school was in sight.
He must come in and rest. He had walked
too far, and lines of pain and fatigue were
plain to be seen. Miss Ashwell decided that
she must take him to the common room, and
then get Mrs. Bronson to make him some hot
tea. But probably he couldn't walk so far!
Perhaps he would faint. Whatever should she
do? Suddenly to her great relief she saw Miss
Meredith in her car evidently returning from
town. Miss Ashwell moved over to the side
of the road, Major Phillips limping after
her, and the line stood still awaiting developments.
Miss Ashwell explained her
predicament to an amazed Head Mistress.
Miss Meredith thought and acted quickly.
Major Phillips was welcomed with both
hands and tucked into the car. Catherine was
summoned.</p>

<p>"My compliments to Mrs. Bronson, Catherine,
and please ask her if she can provide you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
all with hot cocoa and cake after your walk.
Miss Ashwell is coming home with me for tea."</p>

<p>The car drove off, and though the line
moved on decorously towards the much-desired
rest and cocoa, Major Phillips would have been
considerably surprised if he could have heard
its sudden galvanization into speech.</p>

<p>Catherine, who took Miss Ashwell's place
at the end of the line, was obliged to send a
runner ahead with the request,</p>

<p>"Less noise till we reach bounds, please."</p>

<p>But the instant they reached the school
gates the line dissolved and Judith was surrounded
by an excited mob.</p>

<p>"Oh, go on, tell us, Judy."</p>

<p>"Whatever were you doing on the platform?"</p>

<p>"Who is he, anyway?"</p>

<p>"Don't be a piker! Tell us, Judy."</p>

<p>"Fancy Miss Meredith whisking him off
like that."</p>

<p>"Is he really Miss Ashwell's?"</p>

<p>But Judith, though triumphant, was loyally
discreet. He was an old friend of her Uncle
Brian's. She had to speak to Uncle Tom, and
then Uncle Tom and Major Phillips came
down to speak to Miss Ashwell.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>There were some who felt that this was not
all, but Catherine supported Judith and adjured
them not to go into their own houses
and spread romantic tales.</p>

<p>But there are some things which even a
popular prefect cannot achieve. The affair
was discussed in all its details by the tired
forty as they consumed much cocoa and cake
in the sitting-room, and even later, when the
running of many bath-taps proclaimed loudly
the fact that forty tired bodies were being refreshed,
scraps of conversation floated over
the bath partitions.</p>

<p>"Good thing it's his left arm that's hurt."</p>

<p>"Isn't his hair lovely? I adore hair that is
slightly greying!"</p>

<p>"Is it a V.C. he's got?"</p>

<p>"When do you suppose they'll be married?"</p>

<p>"Did you say he was an artist or an engineer?"</p>

<p>"Won't she look lovely in a wedding gown?"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> wouldn't be married in anything but
white."</p>

<p>"Judith Benson thinks she's <i>it</i>. What is
she doing in it anyhow?"</p>

<p>Judith smiled happily in her bath. She
had decided on her bridesmaid's frock.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>JUDITH WINS THE TENNIS CUP</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Spring</span> came early this year and the school
spent much time out of doors during the last
term. Many classes were held in the big
sun porches and in the sheltered spots in the
grounds, and the various teams were hard at
basket-ball and cricket and tennis, even before
breakfast.</p>

<p>It was not so hard now to get up at a quarter
to seven, and Judith and Florence even
joined the B.B.B.'s&mdash;"Before Breakfast Brigade"&mdash;who
pledged themselves to get up in
time for a dip in the swimming-pool or a game
before the breakfast-bell rang.</p>

<p>Judith was especially keen about tennis,
and she improved her game so much that, to
her surprise and delight, even high and mighty
prefects like Patricia and Catherine were asking
her for practice games in preparation for
the House and School Tournaments later on.
Catherine was a very busy person, indeed,
just now; she had an important part in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
play given during prize-giving week and she
was a member of the Senior basket-ball team.
Judith would never be a basket-ball enthusiast,
but she filled a very respectable position on
the Junior team and she could share in the
excitement about the Senior match which was
to be played against Queen's School. Patricia
was working her team hard; every spare
hour was devoted to goal practice, and team
practice came every day as a matter of course.</p>

<p>Nancy had much to tell Judith of last year's
triumph when Eleanor's brilliant play had
won the coveted trophy for York Hill. This
year Queen's were reported to have a marvellous
centre and school gossip held that the
York Hill team would have a hard battle to
keep the shield. Unfortunately, the very day
before the match, Helen Burton, a prefect of
West House, slipped and wrenched her knee,
so that her playing was out of the question.
She was not their most brilliant player by
any means, but she was steady and used her
brains in the game better than most. Althea
Somerset was put in as a substitute, but it was
disconcerting to lose a tried warrior before the
fight began.</p>

<p>Nancy was a timekeeper, and on the day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
of the match Judith took her stand beside her
with the lemons for the refreshment of the
teams. The whole School had lined the campus
to watch the game; at one end were a
group of Old Girls and the staff; near by was
a splash of scarlet marking the visitors from
Queen's School. Judith, watching the trim
figures of the players line up, Queen's with
scarlet ties and bands, York Hill with gold
ties, felt a sudden rush of loyalty at the sight
of her own well-loved prefects.</p>

<p>"They must win&mdash;they must&mdash;there can't
be a doubt of it," said Judith to herself.</p>

<p>The much-talked-of Queen's centre was as
wonderful as gossip had reported. She seemed
like a veritable spider, all arms and legs; try
as she would Althea could not prevent her getting
the ball. And there was a fair-haired girl&mdash;Pamela
by name&mdash;who was the best shot
Judith had ever seen.</p>

<p>The score mounted rapidly for Queen's and
at half-time, when Judith distributed her slices
of lemon, things looked rather dark for York
Hill.</p>

<p>But Patricia had been using her brains
while she played, and Judith and Nancy ministering
to the team heard her final injunctions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>"We'll beat 'em yet. Watch that right
centre and Pamela Price on the left guard;
they're both dandy shots, and they both want
a chance to show off. Mark my words, we'll
get some fine shots the last half. Their weak
point is team-work, and I'm glad to say we're
playing together&mdash;watch your passing&mdash;we're
bound to win!"</p>

<p>Judith and Nancy went back to their posts
in a state of great excitement. There was an
infectious courage and cheeriness about Patricia's
words. Certainly Queen's had five
points to their favour, but just as certainly
York Hill would win!</p>

<p>Up went the ball again and up went the
spider-like centre's long arms, and away went
the coveted ball in the wrong direction. Judith's
heart sank&mdash;this half was going to be just
like the other&mdash;how terrible!</p>

<p>Thirteen-eight&mdash;Fourteen-eight.</p>

<p>The whistle blew. Judith couldn't see what
had happened, but evidently there had been
a foul, for Catherine had a free throw.</p>

<p>York Hill let themselves go for a minute.
Good for Cathy! Seconds were precious now
and the play was swift.</p>

<p>Again the whistle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>This time Patricia took the ball.</p>

<p>York Hill held its breath.</p>

<p>Fourteen-ten.</p>

<p>Nothing succeeds like success!</p>

<p>The York Hill team quickened and became
tense during those last few seconds like a great
orchestra for the finale of a symphony, in
answer to the conductor's baton. Patricia felt
a thrill of pride. How magnificently the team
was responding&mdash;they were playing like one
person&mdash;and that person meant to win&mdash;there
could be no doubt of it.</p>

<p>"Fifteen-fifteen," said the umpire calmly.</p>

<p>Judith standing quietly beside Nancy
wanted to shriek and shout like a young savage&mdash;"We're
going to beat you! We're going
to beat you&mdash;yah!"</p>

<p>Fifteen-seventeen! Good for Althea!</p>

<p>Ah, Pamela Price has scored!</p>

<p>"Good play," said York, generously applauding
a neat shot.</p>

<p>Seventeen-all&mdash;and a minute more to play!</p>

<p>Althea has the ball&mdash;no, there it is&mdash;Patricia's
got it&mdash;</p>

<p>That must be Pamela again&mdash;no, Catherine
has it!</p>

<p>Catherine poised herself and threw.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>A soft sighing sound from hundreds of lips
marked the safe arrival of the ball in the basket,
and then spontaneous cheering drowned
the umpire's voice.</p>

<p>York Hill had the cup for another year!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The cheering over, the teams departed for
afternoon tea, and the audience, breaking up
into little groups, settled down to a discussion
of the points of the game.</p>

<p>"They've certainly a dandy centre, and that
fair girl was a great shot&mdash;but wasn't Cathy
gorgeous! If we'd only had another two
minutes&mdash;one minute&mdash;we'd have beaten 'em
all hollow."</p>

<p>"Wasn't our team-work simply splendid?"
gloated Judith. "I should think Patricia
would be awfully proud. By the way, that
reminds me&mdash;Patricia said I must play off in
the House Tournament to-morrow afternoon.
Come on over to the tennis court. I'll play
you two&mdash;I've got a new serve I want to try.
Oh, dear! I wish there weren't any exams
this term; I'd like to play the whole time."</p>

<p>Next day when Judith looked at the tournament
lists she was astonished to find that she
was to play against Catherine. Catherine for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
the last two years had been South's choice to
play in the School Tournament, and although
she had been beaten by Nelly Smith of West
last year, it was pretty generally conceded
that she would win in the preliminary House
Tournament and play again in the finals.</p>

<p>"Rather rough on me to have to play
against a champion," laughed Judith as they
tossed for counts a little later, "but I'm going
to give you a hard fight, Cathy, see if I don't."</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the spirit of the blue and
golden May day, cool enough to be pleasant,
warm enough to be a joy, or the little breeze
which came floating across the campus carrying
an intoxicating scent of lilacs, but whatever
the reason, some sprite seemed to have
taken possession of Judith, and she threw herself
into the game with such enthusiasm, such
abandon, such elfin-like nimbleness that Catherine
couldn't touch her balls.</p>

<p>There was not a large audience, for cricket
and swimming claimed many, but the crew of
the "Jolly Susan" were there, you may be
sure, and most of South House, for it had
been whispered about that Judith's game was
worth watching.</p>

<p>"Well played," said Eleanor heartily, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Florence called out the score. "Game and
set in Judith's favour! You've improved your
game tremendously, Judy."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Judy," said Catherine; "hardly a
good fight, I'm afraid, rather a good beating."
Try as she did to keep it out there was a little
coldness in Catherine's voice. She was tired
after yesterday's match, and it wasn't particularly
pleasant to be beaten by a youngster
after she had been champion for South for
two years.</p>

<p>Judith's quick ears had caught the note of
coldness, and her gay spirits deserted her instantly.
What did winning a game matter if
Catherine were displeased with her! She was
almost angry with Nancy, who remarked gleefully
after Catherine had gone, "You're almost
sure to be chosen to play for the House
now, Judy, dear. What tremendous luck!"</p>

<p>Judith wouldn't hear of it, and when a little
later Eleanor told her that she was the choice
of the Committee she begged to be let off.</p>

<p>"It really wasn't fair," she protested.
"Cathy was awfully tired and not in good
form, and I was feeling tip-top. I'd hate to
take her place."</p>

<p>But Eleanor was firm. "Catherine," she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
said, "is not playing so well&mdash;she's had too
many irons in the fire, so we'll look to you
to win for South. Patricia says she'll take
you for fifteen minutes every morning before
breakfast. Your net play needs a little steadying&mdash;get
in as much practice as you can before
the tournament."</p>

<p>Eleanor's word was final, and of course it
was gratifying to be chosen, but Judith's pleasure
was spoilt by her fear that Catherine was
hurt and would never be friends with her
again. That night at visiting hour she knocked
at Catherine's door with the resolve to tell her
in some way or other that she was sorry. She
didn't know quite how it was to be done, because
she might only make matters worse.
But instead of Catherine's usual cheerful
"Come in," a preoccupied voice said, "Who's
there?" and to Judith's answer, replied, "Will
another time do, Judy? I'm awfully busy."</p>

<p>Judith went off disconsolately, and when
she did try to express her regret at being
chosen in place of Catherine, her endeavours,
as she feared, were not a success. Catherine
merely said that of course she was glad Judith
was to play, but again her voice was cold.</p>

<p>"Cathy doesn't really mean it," protested<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Nancy, in whom Judith confided. "She's
just busy with the play&mdash;you know she's to
be the heroine&mdash;and she's writing on her
diploma examination too. Cheer up, Judy,
don't look so like an owl."</p>

<p>Judith refused to be comforted; the honour
of the House meant less to her than the friendship
of Catherine whom she had adored from
the first day she entered York Hill. However,
she practiced hard&mdash;Patricia saw to that&mdash;and
when Tournament Day came she had profited
not a little by the week's coaching.</p>

<p>But Patricia was worried. True, Judith's
serve had improved, but she lacked the nerve
and spirit which had made her playing so irresistible
in the House match, and Nelly Smith
was an old hand at the game.</p>

<p>The great day came. Surely Catherine
would wish her luck, and while Judith put on
a fresh white skirt and blouse and made her
hair as trim as possible, she listened for the
sound of Catherine's footsteps&mdash;but no
Catherine came, and Judith went off to the
match with a heavy heart.</p>

<p>The central courts were lined with spectators,
and as they tossed for courts Judith realized
that this was an occasion. The cup was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
to go for a year to the winner of this one match,
for Nelly Smith had already beaten Althea
Somerset of North, and East, being largely a
Junior House, had no representative.</p>

<p>Over by the umpire's stand Judith could see
the crew of the "Jolly Susan"&mdash;Nancy's
pretty golden head and Josephine's untidy red
one. Jane seemed to be holding a flag&mdash;yes,
it must be the "Susan's" flag. If only Catherine&mdash;!</p>

<p>Nelly had the first serve, and the white balls
began to fly back and forth. Nelly won her
serve and then Judith hers. It was steady, interesting
playing. They were well matched.
But Judith's mind was only half on her game,
for while with one half of her brain she countered
Nelly's tactics, the other half was still
occupied with Catherine and the possibility of
losing Catherine's friendship if she won the
game.</p>

<p>Suddenly in a flash Judith saw a solution.
Supposing she didn't win&mdash;and of course she
mightn't&mdash;Nelly was no mean rival&mdash;would
Catherine restore her to friendship? Supposing
she didn't try her very hardest?</p>

<p>Judith's thoughts were centred on Catherine
and the full dishonour of what she was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
contemplating did not occur to her. She only
knew that nothing seemed to matter if she lost
Catherine. Nancy, meanwhile, who surmised
what was troubling Judith, was watching her
anxiously, and because she knew her so well
she saw that Judith was not putting her whole
self into the game, although she had won the
first set by a very narrow margin. Nelly's
score was climbing steadily now&mdash;five-three,
five-four.</p>

<p>"Game and set to Nelly Smith," called
the umpire as the players changed courts, and
when Nelly stooped to tighten a shoelace,
Nancy made a quick decision and whispered in
Catherine's ear:</p>

<p>"Judy's nervous, Cathy; please say something
to cheer her up the way you did at the
play."</p>

<p>The colour deepened ever so slightly in
Catherine's cheeks, for she had been mentally
shaking herself that she had not been more
generous to Judy, so she was quick to seize her
opportunity as Judith passed.</p>

<p>"Good for you, Judibus&mdash;you're certain to
win&mdash;you're doing splendidly. Remember
we're trusting ourselves to you&mdash;but we're
sure of the cup&mdash;you <i>can</i> play!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>Catherine's old self, all the coldness gone,
spoke in the words.</p>

<p>They seemed to be magic words, for a miracle
happened then and there. Nelly fought
hard and it was a battle worth watching, but
Judith was quite certain now that she would
win. Nelly really hadn't a chance against
some one who suddenly realized that she had
not been answering up to the trust her friends
had given her; some one who saw herself restored
to the favour she coveted; some one
who knew now that it didn't matter a bit
whether she lost or won as long as she did her
very best; some one who was suddenly walking
on air, whose eyes and cheeks were glowing
with joy, and whose feet and wits seemed so
nimble that strategy and tactics were blown
to the winds.</p>

<p>The last set went rapidly, and it seemed
afterwards to Judith only a few exhilarating
moments until the umpire was announcing,
"Game and set in favour of Judith Benson,"
and three cheers were being given for her and
three cheers for South. South House had the
cup back again!</p>

<p>Judith had just sufficient presence of mind
left to shake hands with Nelly and thank her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
for the game, and then she was in the midst of
a happy throng of Southerners who shouted
congratulations and told her she was a brick,
and a wonder, and a credit to the House.</p>

<p>Invitations for tea at the tuck shop poured
in thick and fast, but Catherine answered for
her:</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it; she belongs to the 'Jolly
Susan' <i>first</i> of all, and we've a spread of ship's
rations in my room all ready for the occasion."</p>

<p>Judith looked so radiant at the party that
Sally May, who always knew the latest bit of
gossip, said disappointedly,</p>

<p>"I suppose you know about Miss Ashwell,
Judy?"</p>

<p>"What about her?" said Judith eagerly.
"Is she&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she&mdash;is&mdash;engaged! It's frightfully
exciting&mdash;some of the girls saw her ring this
afternoon, and she said yes she was, and
what <i>do</i> you think?" Sally May paused dramatically.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"She's going to be married in prize-giving
week because the Major is going back to
France&mdash;and Miss Meredith is giving her a
school wedding&mdash;only all the Old Girls are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
going to be there&mdash;so they're not sure whether
we'll be invited."</p>

<p>Sally May paused for breath.</p>

<p>Here was room for discussion, indeed. A
wedding! A York Hill wedding! And their
own Miss Ashwell! Surely they would be
invited!</p>

<p>Field Day proved another exciting topic&mdash;they
all decided to enter the suitcase race
and provide some merriment for the School
by the costumes they would produce. The
party broke up reluctantly to dress for dinner.
But Catherine managed to detain Judith for a
moment and say in an undertone:</p>

<p>"I've been horrid lately, Judy&mdash;too busy
with the play to be decent. I suppose you're
getting busy, too, on the Properties Committee;
but I wonder if you could spare time to
hear me my part to-night?"</p>

<p>Could she?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>JUNE SHOWERS</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next two weeks were the busiest and the
happiest that Judith had ever known. It
would have been a joy merely to be alive on
such blue, unclouded days of golden sunshine.
Even examination tests, which she still
dreaded, were bringing with them a curious
happiness.</p>

<p>"I don't know how it is," Judith confided
to the crew of the "Jolly Susan" one morning
as bed-making was in progress, "but there is
something nice about exams after all."</p>

<p>"Nice!" came from Josephine and Jane,&mdash;"Nice!"</p>

<p>"Well, it may be all very well for you if
you want to show off how much ancient history
you've crammed up," said Sally May rather
crossly; "I don't see anything nice about them.
I hate this ancient history, silly old names! I
don't know who won one of these battles"&mdash;and
she continued to mutter to herself a list
of battles of the Peloponnesian War, which she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
was memorizing in preparation for the history
test.</p>

<p>"But," Judith persisted, "there is something
nice about them; it must be measuring ourselves
against others and doing our very best,
just like the high jumping on Field Day.
Now you know very well you enjoyed that,"
she continued, going to Josephine's door and
noting with surprise that Josephine was actually
cleaning her white shoes.</p>

<p>"'Course," said Josephine; "&ccedil;a va sans dire.
Ha! Thought I'd make you open your eyes
quoting French as to the manner born, and
cleaning shoes into the bargain! Mademoiselle
made me learn five phrases&mdash;had to write
them out a hundred times. What I say is, lessons
are lessons, and jumping is jumping;
one's nasty and t'other's nice if you like."</p>

<p>Judith was interested in Josephine's French.</p>

<p>"Let's have the other phrases, Josephine."</p>

<p>"Not me," answered Josephine elegantly.
"Moi, I shall scatter them about gracefully.
Dad will probably think I'm well-educated
when I go home, and if I'm tidy, too, my
mother will be perfectly satisfied."</p>

<p>"Well, you'd better begin on your room,"
said Jane who had joined them. "I notice, Miss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Burley, that you received 'C' and a disorderly
mark last week, and friend Genevieve
says that Miss Watson is on the war-path this
week."</p>

<p>"Miss Marlowe says I'm incorrigible," said
Josephine, sadly shaking her head. "Heigho!
It's hard luck being born so careless; I get
blamed for everything. 'Eh bien! mademoiselle,'
I shall say gently the next time I'm reproved,
'Je ferai mon possible!' and by means
of these choice little French phrases and a
perfectly clean pair of shoes, my reputation
will improve. Voyez!"</p>

<p>Every spare moment was being spent out-of-doors
these days, so Sally May and Judith
took their history books out under Judith's
favorite acacia trees, and Judith good-naturedly,
for every moment was precious, gave
Sally May a half-hour's grind on her ancient
history before morning school. When the ten-minute
bell rang, their books were closed with
a bang almost before the bell had ceased, and
they were dancing and leaping and running
across the lawn and round the tennis courts,
where they ran into Nancy.</p>

<p>"Just think!" she cried, "Margaret Leslie is
going to be house mother for the Old Girls this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
year, and she says that there are about a hundred
out-of-town girls coming to the Reunion,
and of course there'll be heaps of town girls.
Won't it be heavenly?"&mdash;and she hopped on
one foot for joy. Then the three had a race
to the schoolroom door. Middies and bloomers
simply compel one to run and scamper.</p>

<p>Judith thought about the Reunion as the
form filed in silently to prayers. Nancy had
talked about it all year; she thought it the
happiest time of the year, and as she had been
at York Hill all her school days she would
know a number of the girls who were coming
back.</p>

<p>"They are here for four days," Nancy had
told her, "so we just pack those days full.
There's the Reunion tea, and the grandchildren's
party, and the suppers and the plays,
and then Sunday and prize-giving. I get so
happy I feel that I'll burst if I'm not careful."</p>

<p>Form Five were already hard at work on
their songs for the supper party; Judith was
to respond to a toast. The play was well
under way by Easter-time, as Judith knew,
for she was a hard-working member of the
Properties Committee. What she did not
know was that her name had been seriously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
considered for one of the parts and Catherine
and Eleanor had strongly urged her fitness.
But Miss Marlowe had cautioned them:
"Judith has had a good first year, but I'm
not sure that a prominent part in another play
wouldn't spoil it for her. Remember she had
an important part at Christmas-time. Don't
turn her head." Eleanor saw the point and
Judith was instead put on the committee where
she was doing good work.</p>

<p>This year there was the added delight of the
wedding. Last night Miss Meredith had given
the invitations, and the School, you may be
sure, would "accept with pleasure."</p>

<p>Form Five A held a meeting at recess time.
They must get Miss Ashwell a wedding present.</p>

<p>"Form Two and Form Four are going to
give her a hankie shower," said Joyce Hewson,
"and Patricia told me that the Sixth
Form is going to give her a linen shower."</p>

<p>"And Domestic Science are having a
kitchen shower," joined in Frances. "I don't
see what there's left for us."</p>

<p>Books were suggested, but voted down.
"Besides, we haven't enough money," said
Nancy, "Miss Meredith said we mustn't
spend much."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>Nancy wanted to put the money into a
lump sum and buy one nice thing, a picture
or a piece of silver or something like that. But
the majority of the girls favoured the shower
idea. A tea-cup shower was discussed, and
seemed to be the most popular of all the plans
yet made, when Peggy said she believed the
Staff were buying china. She and her mother
had met three of the Staff in Smith's on Saturday
morning, and she guessed from what
they said that that was what they doing.</p>

<p>Judith had been thinking&mdash;what would
Miss Ashwell like? What does she like to do?
And a picture flashed into her mind of Miss
Ashwell in garden hat and gloves snipping
Miss Meredith's rosebushes and talking to
Judith about Gloire de Dijons, and Frau
Druschkis and Prince Ruperts and Lady
Ursulas, as if they were intimate friends.
Judith jumped up excitedly.</p>

<p>"Madam President," she said eagerly, "why
shouldn't we have a flower shower? I mean
plants, rosebushes and Canterbury bells and
lilacs if they haven't got 'em, and maybe a
cherry tree," she added as the plan grew before
her eyes.</p>

<p>Pros and cons were discussed. Perhaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
"White Cottage" already had a good garden.
No, she had heard the Major say&mdash;here Judith
blushed and stammered as she heard Jane
observe, "Great friend of the Major's is
Judy"&mdash;that the garden was no good; anyway,
they could find out. Perhaps Miss
Meredith would find out for them.</p>

<p>"But it'll be too late to plant cherry trees
and lilac bushes," objected Alicia Harris, who
was a practical gardener and had been a
steady worker in the War Garden Committee.
That was so!</p>

<p>Besides, the bride and groom were going to
France and what would the garden do in the
meantime? Judith looked quite blank. Just
when it had seemed such a lovely plan! She
could see the climbing rose she meant to give
and had already congratulated herself on asking
for some extra pocket money for the last
term. But Nancy came to the rescue.</p>

<p>"I know; let's give the money and the order
for the flowers or bushes to a florist and ask
him to set them out in the proper time in the
fall, and we'll give Miss Ashwell a card with
the name of the flowers we have chosen, and,
oh, then we could have rhymes. We'd put
'Violets' on the card and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'The rose is red, the violet's blue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Honey is sweet and so are you'&mdash;</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>and then our own name so she'd know who
gave her the violets. I'd like to give her violets
myself," she added.</div>

<p>But Rosamond had a more practical suggestion
still.</p>

<p>"Let's get the little wooden tags that the
florists use and put on them the name of the
flower, and the giver's name, and then we
could tie another little paper tag to them with
the rhyme on it."</p>

<p>This was received with applause and the resolution
was put to the vote and carried enthusiastically.
Judith looked admiringly at
Nancy and Rosamond as the meeting broke
up and wondered how they could think of such
clever things, and was surprised and delighted
after the meeting when Nancy slipped her arm
through hers and whispered:</p>

<p>"Bully for you, Judy; I don't know how
you think of such clever things."</p>

<p>Next day there was another Form meeting
and a committee was appointed&mdash;Judy was
glad that she was chosen&mdash;to get permission
to go downtown and enquire prices at the
florists. Five B and Five C, whose Presidents<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
applied to Nancy for ideas, decided to further
the scheme by buying fruit bushes, raspberries,
strawberries, currants, gooseberries, and young
fruit trees, and Miss Watson, who was Five
C's Form Mistress, proved a very useful ally,
for a distant relative was a partner in one of
the biggest wholesale florist establishments and
she offered to take the committee there and
get the plants at the lowest possible rates.
Her sudden popularity and the feeling of importance
which pervaded her at each of the
many consultations during the next few days
(for it turned out that Miss Watson had been
brought up in a beautiful old garden at home
in Scotland) were to remain delectable memories
for many a long day.</p>

<p>A 'phone message brought wonderful catalogues
from MacIver &amp; Watson, and for a
day or two the Fifth Form presented a very
studious appearance. Groups of two or three
might be seen in sitting-room or playroom and
out-of-doors on the quadrangle poring over
books, but the interested teachers who observed
this phenomenon also noticed that the books
they earnestly perused were richly and gaudily
illustrated.</p>

<p>Judith had to give up her cherished notion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
of a climbing rose, because the rest of the
"Jolly Susan" were determined to give Canterbury
bells. The proposal had come from
Jane. "They're blue and that's the sailor's
colour and bells are nautical too." So Judith
gave in gracefully and the five of them pooled
their contributions and stipulated what they
wanted, a row of Canterbury bells in the perennial
border. Nancy was strong on perennials.
"We don't want flowers that will die off,"
she said emphatically, "but something that
will come up every year."</p>

<p>"Won't it be nice!" said Judith. "One
spring morning the Major will come in to
breakfast with the cheerful news, 'Spring has
come, my dear, the Peggy Forrest (her violets,
you know) are coming up under the birch
tree. Come and see them.'"</p>

<p>"And Mrs. Major," finished Nancy, laughing,
"will say, 'Please sit down, the coffee
will be cold in another minute.'"</p>

<p>Saturday morning saw the delegation packed
into the school motor off to town under the
chaperonage of Miss Watson. No one noticed
now, you may be sure, how many <i>r's</i> the good
lady rolled and her reminiscences of "Roses
I have known" were received with the greatest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
respect. It took them a long time to decide,
even with their lists culled from the catalogues
and suggestions obtained from Jennings, but
finally every one was satisfied, and they carried
off a box full of the little wooden tags which
Rosamond had wisely suggested.</p>

<p>The business in hand being disposed of,
their thoughts turned with amazing promptness
to ice-cream. Now according to custom
permission might be desired (probably) and
received (possibly) for ice-cream after a special
visit into town during the week, but on
Saturday mornings the shopping party were
under instructions to return home promptly
when the necessary "shopping" was completed.
This expedition seemed to come under neither
heading; true, it was Saturday morning, but
then it was not the regular shopping party.
After some whispered coaxing, Nancy was
prevailed upon to put the delicate question to
Miss Watson. She summoned her sweetest and
most guileless smile as she broached the subject,
but Miss Watson was ready for her. "I was
sure you'd ask, so I got permission from
Miss Marlowe for you to have one dish at Huyler's
or Page &amp; Shaw's. We'll have to hurry."
Miss Watson's popularity was complete!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>The committee worked hard for an hour after
lunch, but finally the last of the tags was
allotted and distributed, and those who were
going out were exhorted not to come back
without their rhymes, as they must be ready
for Monday. Miss Meredith had issued orders
that Miss Ashwell, who was relieved of all
school duties for this last week, must be quite
free after Tuesday, so the showers were to be
held on Monday and Tuesday. The staff were
having a supper-party on Saturday night
when the china was to be presented, and altogether
Miss Ashwell was to be a much-f&ecirc;ted
person.</p>

<p>"Of course the Old Girls will do something
nice," said Nancy&mdash;"trust them. I guess Susanne
is waiting until the out-of-town girls
come. Miss Ashwell has been secretary of the
Old Girls for two years, so she specially belongs
to them. I wonder what they will do."</p>

<p>The next week was packed full to overflowing
with good times. First came the kitchen
shower which the Domestic Science Form had
planned as their share in the festivities.</p>

<p>Judith and Nancy were not invited to the
party, but they coaxed Helen to let them see
the big clothes-basket full of mysterious little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
parcels looking very bride-like in their white
tissue and satin ribbons.</p>

<p>"Miss Ashwell has got to guess what's in
each one," explained Helen importantly as she
cut cake, "and if she doesn't guess right, the
parcel belongs to Major Phillips. Well, just
a small piece, Nancy; here, Judy, you can have
the plate to scrape."</p>

<p>The two were still busily scraping chocolate
icing out of a bowl when the strains of the
wedding march were heard in the next room,
and, peeping through the crack of the kitchen
door, they beheld a rather flustered-looking
Miss Ashwell trying to guess the first parcel.</p>

<p>Helen shooed them off, declaring they had
no manners at all, and that they had better
see that they were ready for their own party.</p>

<p>Judith and Nancy were indignant at the
implication that they were not well prepared
for the morrow, but just before "Lights out"
bell sounded, Judith asked Sally May to let
her see the rhyme for the Canterbury bells tag.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;I thought you and Nancy were
doing it. I heard you trying to get a rhyme
for 'Susan.'"</p>

<p>"Well, we couldn't," said Judith weakly;
"I thought you had one written already."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>"We'll have to get up at six o'clock, every
one of us," declared Nancy; "put a pencil and
paper beside your bed; each of us has got to
have a rhyme and then we'll choose the best."</p>

<p>There was much yawning and stifled groaning
next morning, but Nancy was firm and
refused to retire to her own cubicle until she
had seen each member of the crew provided
with pencil and paper.</p>

<p>The fires of poetic genius burned low at
such an early morning hour, but they knew, as
well as Nancy did, that there would be no time
after breakfast. So after much frowning and
biting of pencils, five verses were written, and
handed to Catherine to choose the best.</p>

<p>It was an exciting afternoon. There was a
Senior cricket match being played and the
Fifth-Formers were loath to lose one minute of
that. Judith and Nancy were especially keen
to watch Catherine's play. They would dash
over to the match for ten minutes, and then
race off to squeeze lemons, or see if the cakes
had come, and then back again to the match.</p>

<p>Josephine and Joyce had made a huge bouquet
of tea-roses interspersed with samples of
the trees and shrubs and flowers which were
to be planted in the "White Cottage" garden.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Day girls had been requested to bring samples
of cherry trees and gooseberry bushes and such
things as were not to be found at York Hill.
It was a somewhat curious-looking bouquet,
however, for to each spray was attached a little
wooden tag bearing the donor's name, and a
bit of paper with the accompanying rhyme.</p>

<p>Miss Ashwell looked adorably pretty, they
all agreed, when she and Miss Meredith joined
them in the latter's garden after the cricket
match. The guests were escorted to the wicker
chairs under the trees and the girls seated
themselves on rugs.</p>

<p>There was a moment's pause. Miss Ashwell
confessed afterwards to a feeling of nervousness
as to what was going to happen to
her, for the day before, without a moment's
notice, she had been literally showered with
hankies by the little First-Formers. However,
Sally May was discovered on her feet
about to make a speech. Sally May, usually
so glib of tongue, moistened her lips several
times, and then, holding out the bouquet, she
delivered at breakneck speed the little speech
which she had composed&mdash;and fortunately
memorized&mdash;for the occasion.</p>

<p>"Had the fright of my life, my dear," she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
whispered to Judith afterwards. "I felt like
Alice in Wonderland growing taller and taller
every moment&mdash;expected to be lost in the
tree-tops. I'll never, never, never try to make
a speech again."</p>

<p>Miss Meredith, who had also been presented
with a bunch of lovely roses, leaned forward
to examine Miss Ashwell's.</p>

<p>"Yours seems to be an unusually interesting
bouquet, my dear," she observed. "May
I see one of those butterflies? He seems to be
on an apple-tree bough." And unfolding the
wings of the butterfly&mdash;the butterflies were
Five B's idea&mdash;she read:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Drifting from the apple boughs, foam of pink and white<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Rippling through the branches in the green spring light;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">All the elfin breezes in the world, you see,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Have come to play at snowflakes in your apple tree."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"<i>Your</i> apple tree! how charming!" said
Miss Meredith; "who is the fairy godmother
who is going to give you such a fascinating
tree?" And taking up the little wooden tag she
read, "St. Lawrence Apple, Frances Purdy."</p>

<p>"Miss Ashwell must read the next one,"
said Joyce after Frances's rhyme had been applauded,
and she grinned rather wickedly as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
Miss Ashwell took the green branch held out
to her and read the tag:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Black currants, you know,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In your garden which grow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Have more uses than perhaps you would think;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">When hubby's in bed, with a cold in his head,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">You may give him a black-currant drink."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Miss Ashwell's cheeks were as pink as the
lovely rose from whose stalk she hurriedly
took the next verse:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Roses pink and white and nodding,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Roses drenched with dew;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">What would you have but roses</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">By a cottage built for two?"</span><br />
</div>

<p>Rosamond's effort was the signal for a
burst of merriment:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"This bush will bring you wit and mirth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">You'll happy be and merry,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For in your house you'll never have</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">A goose, but nice goose-berry."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"I wanted to say gooseberry pies," said
Rosamond, "but it wouldn't rhyme." And
she couldn't understand why their laughter
was redoubled.</p>

<p>The crew of the "Jolly Susan" were becoming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
uneasy. Would Miss Ashwell overlook
the bluebells in Five A's bouquet? Nancy
held up the flowers for Miss Ashwell to choose,
and rather ostentatiously turned the bluebells
towards her, but she perversely chose Olivia's
pansies. Five o'clock had rung and the maids
were crossing the lawn with trays of the inevitable
cake and lemonade. The crew felt desperate.
Perhaps it was a case of telepathy,
for, with her hand hovering over Marjorie's
hollyhocks, Miss Ashwell seemed to change
her mind and took up instead the bluebells:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Bells from a crew of pirates bold<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">That sail the 'Jolly Susan,'</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With bells the time is always told</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">When our good ship's a-cruisin,'</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Heave-aho, my laddies, oh,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">All the bells are swinging,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Flower-bells and ship bells, for your wedding ringing."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"They are to be Canterbury bells really,"
explained Josephine to Miss Ashwell as the
lemonade was being served and the rest of the
tags were being passed about so that they
might all be read. "We hope you'll plant
them in a long row: Canterbury was an awfully
hard word to put into a poem, you
know."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's the nicest verse of all," declared Miss
Ashwell. "They'll be lovely in a row. What
a garden I'm going to have!"</p>

<p>Nancy and Judith lingered after the party
broke up. They made themselves very busy
clearing away lemonade glasses and stray
chairs just out of earshot of Miss Ashwell and
Miss Meredith, who were talking busily. They
hoped within themselves that Miss Meredith
would depart, and Judith hoped that Nancy
would go, and Nancy hoped that Judith
would go.</p>

<p>But the five-thirty bell sounded and Nancy
reluctantly went off to a music-lesson. Judith
gathered up some bits of paper under a peony
bush and with a sigh of relief saw Miss Meredith
hurry away. Now was her chance. She
waylaid Miss Ashwell at the door.</p>

<p>"Oh, Judy, it's been the loveliest party ever,"
said Miss Ashwell, putting her arm round
Judith and giving her a happy little hug; "the
nicest party I ever was at. However did you
think of it all?"</p>

<p>And be it recorded in Judith's favour that
she did not claim credit for the idea.</p>

<p>"We're awfully glad you liked it, for we
wanted to give you something that wouldn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
let you forget us." How ever was she to tell
Miss Ashwell how she was going to miss
her next year. "I'm glad to be one of the
Canterbury bells, but I wanted a special flower
of my own for you, something that would be
sweet and rosy and&mdash;and&mdash;dear, so please
don't let any one else give you a climbing rose
because I want to give you one that will climb
up and knock at your window in the early
morning and say&mdash;" But she couldn't get
any further. She had suddenly realized that
in two weeks' time Miss Ashwell would be
gone, that she loved her, and hated to think
that next year some one else would be in the
dear little room at the end of the corridor where
she had so often found rest and comfort. A
miserable lump swelled in her throat&mdash;she
couldn't say another word.</p>

<p>"I know," said Miss Ashwell; "the roses
will tap at the window and say, 'Get up, lazy
person, and come out and weed the garden
and clip the roses before breakfast,' or,
'Hurry, hurry, Judith and Nancy and all the
rest of them are coming down to-day for lunch,
this is a gala day,' or perhaps they'll just be
fragrant and lovely and bring sweet remembrances
of York Hill and Judith."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you," said Judith rather hoarsely,
but she went away brimful of happiness because
she knew that once more Miss Ashwell
had understood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>A TOAST TO THE SCHOOL</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> woke early Friday morning with a
feeling that something was going to happen.
"What is it?" she asked herself sleepily. "An
examination? No! Thank goodness, they
are all over for this year." Now she remembered,
this was the day of the Reunion&mdash;and
the Wedding! No wonder that she felt that
something was going to happen. What a day
it was going to be!</p>

<p>She stretched lazily, and instantly Nancy,
who heard her moving, whispered:</p>

<p>"You awake, Judy? I can't sleep. The
Old Girls are coming to-day. Oh, Goody!
Goody! If the bell doesn't ring soon I'll
burst. I simply must shout a little bit."</p>

<p>Nancy's smiling face appeared over the wall
of the cubicle.</p>

<p>"Let's get up and be all dressed when the
bell does ring, and then we can slip out into
the garden."</p>

<p>"We'll have to be awfully quiet going for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
our baths," objected Judith, who didn't feel
as energetic as Nancy appeared to be; "you
go first."</p>

<p>Nancy agreed, but when she came back all
rosy from her bath Judith was sound asleep.
Nancy tiptoed over to the bed determined to
wash the sleeper's face with a bath-sponge,
when something in the utter relaxation of
Judith's attitude struck her. Judith was tired,
very tired. "And no wonder," thought Nancy,
as she stole quietly and with infinite precautions
back to her own room, "it makes me
tired even to <i>think</i> of all we've done this week,
and all there is to do yet, but it's awfully jolly.
Poor Judy! What a good thing she's got her
speech all ready for to-night. I am glad she
isn't on the refreshment committee."</p>

<p>There was an air of excitement in the dining-room
even at breakfast-time. Reminiscences
of Old Girls were the order of the day,
and Judith learned the names of some of the
more famous graduates. She must look out
for Kathryn Fleming, who had been singing
in New York all season, but she couldn't miss
her, she wasn't the sort who was easily overlooked;
and Julia Weston, a judge of the Juvenile
Court out West; and Penelope Adams,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
who had married a millionaire and was a great
belle; and Martha Penrose, who was just "the
sweetest little Virginian you ever saw"; and
her chum, Winifred Freeman, who was matron
of a big hospital; and Kitty Fisken, the
artist; and Isobel Grier, who married Professor
Mitchell. Judith finally put her fingers
in her ears.</p>

<p>"Don't tell me about any more of them,"
she begged. "I'm beginning to get the same
dazed feeling I had the first night I was here&mdash;I
felt smothered in people."</p>

<p>Breakfast was usually a rather quiet time,
but to-day there was such a clattering and
chattering that Miss Langton rang the bell
and asked for "Lower voices, please." Judith's
neighbour, Marjory, grinned.</p>

<p>"This isn't anything to what it will be by
to-morrow," she said.</p>

<p>Even the maids seemed infected by the spirit
of gaiety, but if they moved more briskly than
usual perhaps it was because they knew that
there would be many extra tables for them to
serve at luncheon-time.</p>

<p>By nine o'clock the noise in the corridor
was deafening. Old Girls could evidently
make a row when they chose. Such cries of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
joy on meeting their special pals! Such questionings
and laughings! Such greetings with
the Staff who forgot all about their waiting
forms in their desire to welcome So-and-So
and to hear the latest news of some one else!
Miss Martin gave them ten minutes' grace
before the bell rang for prayers, and then the
Old Girls joined the Sixth and took their
places in Big Hall once more. How happy
Miss Meredith looked as the hymn was sung.</p>

<p>Judith found it difficult to listen to the reading
of the lesson; she wished she had eyes in
the back of her head to see the Old Girls with
the Sixth. Nancy had told her before prayers
that Evelyn Coulson, last year's Captain, had
arrived, and Penelope Adams, looking perfectly
stunning, and Dr. Mary Burgess, who
had been in command of a Woman's Hospital
Unit in Serbia. Judith wanted to see her most
of all, and she wondered if Aunt Nell were with
the others.</p>

<p>Prayers over, they went back to their form
rooms, the Old Girls crowding into the Sixth-Form
room for a talk from Miss Meredith;
but Miss Meredith was detained for a few moments
and they had a chance for reminiscences.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you remember Miss Watson's plaid
skirt? My dear, she has on the identical
skirt now and her hair is just the same, only
more so."</p>

<p>"Do you remember the time, Kathryn, you
had to learn the 116th Psalm for Miss Meredith,
and thought she said the 119th?" said a
plump young matron with the contented look
which belongs to mothers of happy little families.
"<i>I</i> remember if you don't for you made
our nights and days miserable hearing you,
and then it was all a mistake."</p>

<p>"Do you remember the first debate we had
on woman's rights? Gracious me, we thought
we were advanced thinkers and no mistake."</p>

<p>"Do you remember the time Grace Wilton
tried to trick the Infirmary nurse by pouring
her dose of castor oil down a rubber tube attached
to a bottle hid in her blouse, and how
she poured it down the tube all right, but not
into the bottle? She <i>was</i> in a mess."</p>

<p>"And do you remember Alice Roberts,
when we had the measles epidemic, rubbing
her chest with a stiff hairbrush and complaining
of headache so that when nurse looked at
her she sent her off to the Isolation House&mdash;to
join her special pal?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>The Sixth hung on the outskirts of the crowd
drinking in stories of the good old days, and
then there was a sudden quiet in the room;
Miss Meredith had returned and was standing
by the desk looking at them so tenderly, so
understandingly, that every girl knew that
the Head Mistress had come in to them with
the prayer in her heart that she might be able
to give a message of strength and inspiration.</p>

<p>Such prayers are answered.</p>

<p>After the lesson the Old Girls moved away
in little groups down to the Big Hall where
they were to have their annual business meeting.
A great deal of business was despatched
during the next hour; notices of motion were
given for the next meeting, the reports of various
committees were read and approved, the
question of this year's administration of the
scholarship fund discussed with much interest,
and suggestions made as to the form which
this year's gift to the School should take. The
President got through the business on hand
as quickly as possible, for, as she pointed out,
they had a real York Hill wedding on their
hands, and the meeting adjourned to decorate
Big Hall for the ceremony. They left it a
bower of beauty. Some of the Old Girls had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
motored out to the country and brought great
masses of white and purple lilac, and sweet-scented
syringa, and big jars held the roses
that the bride loved.</p>

<p>Judith and the rest of the "Jolly Susan"
crew had begged to be allowed to help since
they were Miss Ashwell's own cubicle girls,
and they had a joyous time unpacking flowers
which kept arriving, speculating as to the
bride's gown, and wondering what they would
feel like if they were going to be married that
very afternoon.</p>

<p>"Next year won't be a bit the same,"
mourned Judith as she handed festoons of
green to Nancy who was decorating the front
of the platform. "Miss Ashwell will be gone
and Catherine and Eleanor. I don't see whatever
we'll do."</p>

<p>"Oh, it'll be up to us," laughed Nancy,
stepping back to admire the handiwork.</p>

<p>"Us?" said Judith, aghast. "Why, I never
thought of that before. I suppose we will be
in the Sixth Form."</p>

<p>"Well, you're going to be," said Nancy with
conviction. "I don't know whether I'll manage
it or not. Oh, we'll have heaps to do next
year, never fear. Let's go and dress now so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
we'll have plenty of time to arrange the last
things for the supper."</p>

<p>Jane and Josephine were discussing the possibility
of the bride appearing in a real wedding
gown. To Judith's disappointment the popular
vote seemed against it, since the wedding
had been so hurriedly arranged. But when
a little later Miss Ashwell looking her loveliest
came down the aisle on Miss Meredith's arm,
the most romantic of her romantic audience
was satisfied with her truly bride-like appearance.
Some of the girls afterwards could tell
any number of details about the way the orange
blossoms fastened her veil, and how the long
train was lined, and whether her shoe buckles
were of silver or of brilliants, but Judith had
eyes only for the lovely face with its expression
of serene and radiant happiness.</p>

<p>Judith had hoped that she would have a
chance for a last word of good-bye, but outside
on the lawn the Old Girls and Staff crowded
around the bride and monopolized her, and the
School gave itself up philosophically to an
orgy of ice-cream and bride's cake. Then in
some magical way the bride was spirited away
to change for the journey, and all Judith could
hope for was a word at the very end or at least<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
a piece of the bride's bouquet which was tossed
out of the carriage. But she seemed doomed
to disappointment. Miss Ashwell was gone
without a word and Judith turned and fled to
her room. To her surprise she found Elise,
Miss Meredith's maid, just leaving the "Jolly
Susan."</p>

<p>"I have put a note and parcel for you on
your dressing-table, Miss Benson," said Elise.
"Mrs. Phillips said I was to be most particular
to bring it to you the minute she was gone."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Phillips"&mdash;Judith looked bewildered
and then caught the smile on Elise's face&mdash;"Thank
you, Elise," she said breathlessly,
and rushed into her cubicle. There lay a letter
and a tiny parcel. The letter first:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><span class="smcap">Judy dear</span>&mdash;<br />

<p>If I had had bridesmaids I would have asked you to
"stand up with me." You have been a loving, loyal little
friend, and David and I want you to wear this little pin
as a token of our gratitude to our "messenger."</p>

<div class='right'>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">Remember I am still</span><br />
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Your friend,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Elizabeth Ashwell Phillips</span>.<br />
</div>
</div>

<p>For a moment a suspicious moisture blinded
Judith's eyes; then curiosity urged her to open
the little white box. "What a <i>darling</i> pin!"
she breathed as the lid flew back and disclosed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
three beautiful pearls exquisitely set in a plain
white gold bar. "And what a darling she is&mdash;and
if it had to be some one I'm glad it's the
Major."</p>

<span class="caption">THEN CURIOSITY URGED HER TO OPEN THE LITTLE WHITE BOX</span>
</div>

<p>This ever-to-be-remembered day still held
another great event&mdash;the Reunion supper.
So Judith dried her eyes and went out to the
lawn again where she found the Decorating
Committee of the New Girls hard at work.
It was such a warm evening that permission
had been given to have the supper out on the
board tennis court. Benches, which were
to be used as tables, were being carried from
Big Hall and placed in a square on the boards;
rugs and sofa cushions were placed beside
them, for Form Five intended to sit cross-legged
at their feast in true Eastern fashion.
The benches or tables were decorated with
pretty paper napkins, and every new girl had
brought down anything she possessed in the
way of a flower vase, and these Marjorie and
Frances were filling with flowers donated by
the day girls. Judith found that she could
help here; her special task was the pasting of
a label bearing the owner's name on the bottom
of each vase. Althea and Marian with three
or four helpers were tying Chinese lanterns<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
over the electric lights which Brodie had
strung for them across the boards. Sally May
and her committee were engaged in putting
the last touches to the place cards, for true to
her nature Sally May had refused to be hurried
and the cards were still to be finished.</p>

<p>Judith felt her heart beginning to thump
uncomfortably as she thought of the toast she
had to answer. Sally May was to be toastmistress
and to Judith had been given the
honour of replying to the last toast&mdash;the
toast to "The School." Judith was glad that
she had written out her little speech last week,
for the last few days had been so packed full
that she had not had a moment to herself.</p>

<p>The tables were finished to the satisfaction
of every one, and then Judith found Nancy,
and asked her if she would hear her speech.
They found a secluded spot and Judith recited
a little eulogy of York Hill.</p>

<p>"It's tremendously good, Judy," said
Nancy admiringly. "I think that part about
the experiences of the first week is awfully
funny, and I like the ending too&mdash;'Ring out
the old, ring in the new'&mdash;It makes us think
of next year, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you're not a severe critic,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
said Judith, flushing with pleasure at Nancy's
honest admiration, "but I want it to be my
very best."</p>

<p>"Come on, you two," cried Sally May at
this juncture. "Do come and see the other
tables."</p>

<p>They visited Nancy's table first.</p>

<p>"Oh, how sweet your flowers look!" said
Judith, admiring the little old-fashioned posies
in their stiff paper frills.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Hewson sent us in several boxes from
her country place, and Joyce and Phyllis made
the frills. They do look quaint, don't they?"</p>

<p>"What thrilling place cards!" cried Sally
May. "Look, Judy&mdash;four snapshots on each
one&mdash;are they all the same, Nancy?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Jane and Marjorie collected eight
or ten snaps from the girls who had cameras
and then they printed enough for every one
to have four. Every one has some view or
other of the School, and every one has a
picture of one of the prefects."</p>

<p>"Here's a perfectly sweet one of Catherine,"
said Judith, pouncing on one on the other
side of the table; "here's Miss Meredith's
house&mdash;and what's this?" Squeals of
delight from both of them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, it's Josephine and Jane in their carnival
costumes, and here's Eleanor at the
wicket. Oh, Nancy, what perfectly glorious
place cards! Wouldn't I just love to have
one!"</p>

<p>"Wait till next year," said Nancy; "but
I'll try to get some of the snaps for you," she
added in a lower tone as a dozen or more New
Girls came in to admire.</p>

<p>"Come on over and see ours now," said
Judith hospitably. "I'm dying myself to
see our place cards. Sally May has kept them
a great secret."</p>

<p>Nancy was appreciative and admired the
lights and the paper napkins, and then the
place cards came in for their share of praise.
Sally May's cheeks grew pink with pleasure
as Judith and Nancy became more and more
enthusiastic. Sally May was really very clever
with her pencil and on each card she had drawn
a little sketch reminiscent of the New Girls'
Play at Christmas. Scrooge was there, of
course, "before and after," Judith said laughingly
as she ran from one place to another&mdash;and
Tiny Tim, and Bob Cratchit, and the
boy with the turkey, and the ghost, and
Martha. Sally May had looked up several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
illustrated editions of the "Christmas Carol"
and Miss Carlton had given her and Florence
permission to work on the cards during Studio
hours. They had taken ever so long, but Florence
had been a brick and they were finished
at last. Edith and Helen had printed in the
toast list.</p>

<p>Judith shivered as she saw her name at the
bottom of the list. How she wished she had
spent more time on her speech&mdash;how <i>could</i>
she put into words at all what she felt about
the School?</p>

<p>She felt this more keenly than ever before
as she stood arm in arm with Nancy and looked
in through the windows of the dining-hall at
the tables prepared for the Old Girls. She
heard Nancy and Sally May exclaiming over
the lovely irises which decked the long tables,
but she was thinking of the girls who had
gathered from all over the wide Dominion to
visit again their old School. Judith had felt
vaguely the same emotion as she saw the Old
Girls marching into Big Hall in the morning,
but she felt it now with a rush of warm feeling&mdash;School
seemed infinitely more dear, more
worth while, bigger. There must be something
very big in York Hill, she thought, something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
very strong, to draw back every year these
hundreds of Old Girls.</p>

<p>Nancy was pointing out celebrities. "That
must be Kathryn Fleming. Isn't she simply
stunning?" she said, as a tall, fair-haired
woman in gold-and-white brocade entered
the Hall; "and there's Judge Weston and
Miss Fisken&mdash;what a gorgeous gown!&mdash;looks
Chinese. I wonder who that small, black-haired
girl is! She looks as if she played the
violin or wrote plays or something."</p>

<p>"She probably stays at home and dusts the
drawing-room," said Judith, laughing.</p>

<p>"Don't be horrid," pouted Sally May.
"Oh, there's Mrs. Dexter. Wouldn't it be
thrilling to be President? You'd make a good
President, Judy, you're so tall. Come on,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>They found numbers of the New Girls already
standing about under the Chinese lanterns
admiring the work of the Decorating
Committee, and some of them, we regret to
add, casting hungry glances at the rolls and
salad which were already on the table.</p>

<p>Judith found herself seated next to Sally
May and opposite Frances, who was to reply
to the toast to "Our first days at York Hill."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>How they enjoyed their supper! For once,
to be able, while at School, to have exactly what
you desired to eat, limited only, of course, by
the amount of the tax levied on each member!
Marjorie and Edith, who had been responsible
for the ordering of the food, had many congratulations
passed down to their end of the
table, and Sally May felt amply repaid for the
trouble she and her committee had taken with
the place cards when she heard the exclamations
of delight on all sides.</p>

<p>Judith, already excited and keyed up by
the events of the day, and susceptible as always
to beauty in any shape or form, could hardly
eat at all. It was an exquisite June evening.
The magic and charm of the coloured lanterns,
the warm splashes of colour made by the
sweater coats and cushions, the soft, rosy glow
of the fading sunset, and the silver of a young
moon, all made for Judith a veritable fairy-land.
If only she hadn't to answer the toast
she could be perfectly and absolutely happy.</p>

<p>But all too soon lemonade glasses were refilled
for the toasts, and Joyce fidgeted and
cleared her throat preparatory to giving "The
King." "God save the King" was sung with a
will, and then Frances proposed "Our Country"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
and this was followed by "O Canada,"
and "My Country, 'tis of Thee." Marjorie
had brought her violin to accompany the songs,
and the thin, silvery notes and the clear, fresh
voices of the singers sent little shivery thrills
of pleasure up and down Judith's spine.</p>

<p>Judith's toast was coming now. Quite suddenly
she knew that she hadn't been able to
realize before what York Hill stood for&mdash;to
herself, to all these New Girls, and to all the
Old Girls who had come back to pay a tribute
to the School they loved. Whatever could
she do? She tried to think of something else
to say, but Frances Purdy was speaking now
and the bursts of laughter all about were too
infectious to withstand. Frances was describing
the woes of her first week. She had
been told that she must say "ma'am" to all
the Sixth-Form girls, and that new girls must
get up before the others and have their baths
before the bell rang, and she convulsed her
audience by a description of her first ecstatic
experience in the tuck shop. She had been
informed that the School provided buns and
milk at recess, and meeting a neighbour who
was consuming a particularly luscious-looking
Chelsea bun at recess-time, she enquired where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
they were to be found. She was directed to
the tuck shop in the gymnasium, where she
spent some happy moments choosing buns and
cakes and sweets, all of which the presiding
genius had asserted, in answer to her enquiries,
she might have at recess. Her admiration
for a School where this kind of thing was done
was only equalled by her dismay when she discovered
her mistake and was requested to hand
over twenty-three cents!</p>

<p>And now came the last and most important
toast of all, and the School song was sung with
a right good will. Judith stood up and found
herself in the grip of an emotion stronger than
herself. She looked out through the trees
where she saw the lights streaming out from
the dining-hall where the Old Girls were
gathered; away off to the right was Miss Meredith's
green-shaded lamp burning on her study
table; in front she could see the lights in the
common room and the library; here beside her
was the gymnasium where most of her own
particular friends were sitting at another table&mdash;and
all these people were bound together by
one thing&mdash;love and loyalty to York Hill.</p>

<p>The song was ended&mdash;they were waiting
for her to speak; here and there in the semi-darkness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
she could distinguish a puzzled face;
had they been waiting long? With an effort
she opened her paper, no, it wouldn't do&mdash;she
crushed it in her hand and waited for a
minute till her heart should stop throbbing in
her throat. Then she spoke, falteringly at first.</p>

<p>"Some of us were conceited&mdash;and&mdash;selfish.
We thought about ourselves mostly when we
came here last September, but York Hill has
made us despise our littleness and long to be
bigger and broader; some of us didn't know
how to use our bodies or our brains, but the
School has taught us how to be true sports
and how to think straight; some of us had
mighty small ideals about what things really
mattered; but York Hill has shown us how 'to
play the game, and be true to the best we
know.'" Judith faltered as she remembered
how many times she had failed to live up to
that best, her voice broke, and tears shone on
her lashes. "Some of us are little fools&mdash;but
we're going to see to it that we don't stay
fools, we're going to be women that York Hill
will be proud of when we come back to the Old
Girls' Reunion."</p>

<p>And then she sat down feeling limp and tired
and wishing that she could run upstairs to her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
room and hide her head under the pillows.
But the girls were applauding whole-heartedly.</p>

<p>"It's awfully kind of them," thought Judith;
"they know how miserable I feel breaking
down like that&mdash;in front of everybody."</p>

<p>"You made the speech of the evening,
Judy," said Sally May as Judith joined her a
little later in the Gymnasium for the
Sixth-Form Dance.</p>

<p>"Don't be silly, Sally May. I failed, that's
what I did, and just when I wanted badly to
say 'thank you' to the School."</p>

<p>"Of course she made the best speech," said
Nancy, putting her arm through Judith's,
"Florence has been telling me about it." And
Judith greatly comforted went off to have the
first dance with Nancy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>PRIZE-GIVING</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the excitement of the previous day,
Saturday morning felt a little flat and insipid.
There was still plenty to do&mdash;desks to clean,
trunks to pack, the last preparations to be
made for to-night's play&mdash;a hundred and one
things in fact.</p>

<p>The crew of the "Jolly Susan" were not
particularly jolly; they were tired, and they
hated to take down pictures and curtains, and
dismantle their pretty rooms.</p>

<p>Next year wouldn't be the same, they assured
each other; they'd never be all together
again: Sally May wasn't even sure if she were
returning to York Hill. Josephine expected
to be back and Jane probably, and Nancy and
Judith. Judith was glad that there wasn't
any question as to whether Nancy would return.
She was rapidly coming to the place
where she felt that she simply couldn't live
without Nancy. Indeed, the summer holidays,
even with Daddy and Mother home again, had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
seemed long and blank until she had received
permission to invite her special friend to spend
a month at the Benson's camp in the North.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Of all the ships that sail on land,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">There's none like 'Jolly Susan';</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Her crew works well with heart and hand,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And sometimes they're amusin',"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>sang Josephine in her deep voice. "It's the
number of things I've got to remember that's
weighing down <span class="smcap">my</span> young mind. Judy, do
come in here and help me&mdash;you're so supernaturally
tidy, perhaps <i>you</i> can tell me how to
separate the sheep from the goats."</div>

<p>"Tidy, nothing," said Judith cheerfully,
surveying Josephine's wardrobe and personal
belongings spread over the entire room. "But
why sheep?"</p>

<p>"Sheep-things I keep for prize-giving, and
the play and the journey; goats&mdash;the rest,
all of which must go into the big trunk and
depart in two hours for the station. I know
I'll pack my white slippers or my toothbrush
or something equally important unless
some kind soul will take me&mdash;and mine&mdash;in
hand."</p>

<p>"Let's make a list of what you'll want for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
the journey," said Judith, setting to work with
a will, "then you sort and I'll pack."</p>

<p>"Jack and Tom are coming to-night," said
Nancy, bursting into the "Jolly Susan" a
little later, holding an open letter in her hands.
"Isn't Miss Meredith a brick? She sent them
special invitations when I told her Jack was
still in town."</p>

<p>Nancy looked excited and beckoned Judith
into her room where she pointed to two violet-coloured
boxes.</p>

<p>"They've sent us the loveliest flowers,"
she said in a low tone; "it's a shame we can't
have them at prize-giving, but only the Sixth
carry flowers&mdash;let's put them in water and
we'll wear them to-night at the play."</p>

<p>Judith took off the wrappings. "<span class="smcap">Aren't</span>
they adorable? I never saw such darling little
roses&mdash;how <span class="smcap">awfully</span> nice of them!"</p>

<p>Judith had never had flowers sent to her
before and she felt that it was quite
an occasion, and in some mysterious way
marked the fact that she was growing up
and next year would be in the Sixth. It
WAS exciting.</p>

<p>"The play's to begin at seven sharp," called
Jane. "Did you see the notice?&mdash;early lunch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
and an hour's quiet before prize-giving. What
a bore!"</p>

<p>"I'll be glad of it," said Sally May. "I'm
not altogether sure of some of my speeches. I
know I'm going to be fearfully nervous."</p>

<p>"I'll hear you after lunch," said Judith&mdash;"'I
have a high respect for your nerves, Mrs.
Bennet. They are my old friends. I have
heard you mention them with consideration
these twenty years at least!'"</p>

<p>"I believe you know at least half of 'Pride
and Prejudice' by heart," said Nancy admiringly.</p>

<p>"Well, not half," Judith laughed, "but I
love it. I'd rather play Elizabeth myself than
any other part I know, and so I'm just crazy
glad that Catherine's going to do it. Miss
Marlowe didn't want to give Catherine another
heavy part after being Viola and she
tried Helen and Esther, but they simply
couldn't do it. Catherine is too sweet for
words. You should hear her say to Mr. Collins,
'Do not consider me now as an elegant female,
intending to plague you!' Catherine an elegant
female! Mr. Collins is simply killing.
I do hope Eleanor will be careful of the coat&mdash;it's
really too tight for her."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're a brick, Judy," said Josephine
appearing in the doorway. "The trunk is
ready for Brodie. My word, what stunning
roses! No, don't tell me who sent 'em. I'll
have three guesses."</p>

<p>"Come on," cried Judith hurriedly, "we've
got to see that everything is in place for to-night.
Patricia said we were to be in the gym
by eleven sharp."</p>

<p>And she rushed off followed more slowly
by Josephine who vowed that she wasn't
going to escape a chaffing by such diplomatic
exits.</p>

<p>Patricia and several of the Properties Committee
were already at work. Brodie and
Robert had put up the extension to the platform,
the footlights and the big green curtains,
and had brought over from Miss Meredith's
house some charming pieces of old mahogany;
the scenery painted by the Studio class
was stacked against the wall; in fact all the
materials out of which was to be evolved an
eighteenth-century drawing-room were ready
at hand.</p>

<p>"Josephine, you and Rosamond take this list
and check it over please to make certain that
everything's ready for Edith. Be <span class="smcap">sure</span> you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
don't forget a single thing&mdash;we'll be in a fearful
rush after prize-giving. Seven is a perfectly
awful hour to begin. Now keep your
wits about you, Josephine&mdash;go over everything
carefully."</p>

<p>"Right-o," replied Josephine; "give a dog
a bad name&mdash;and hang him. No one believes
in me just because my hair is untidy. You'll
live to see the day, Patricia, when&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Clear out," said Patricia, laughing at Josephine's
solemn indignation. "I've got millions
of things to do&mdash;now, please look after
your share. Come on, Judy, let's tackle this
parlour."</p>

<p>"Oh, how sweet!" cried Judith as they pulled
out the big awkward screen. "Three cheers
for the Studio girls! Wherever did you get
such old-fashioned wall-paper, Peggy?"</p>

<p>"Miss Ashwell found it in one of the shops,"
said Peggy, "and we painted the border ourselves
to match the chintz. Aren't those frilly
little petticoats for the chairs the cunningest
things?"</p>

<p>They worked hard for a couple of hours,
and when curtains were hung at the windows
which gave glimpses of an old-fashioned garden,
and pictures and bric-&agrave;-brac, such as our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
grandmothers loved, in their appointed places,
they felt that the result justified their labours.</p>

<p>Judith produced a list and checked it over&mdash;yes,
everything was ready but the candlesticks,
and she'd get those now, and remind
Patricia about the draperies which were to
transform Mrs. Bennet's parlour into a ball-room
or Lady de Burgh's drawing-room.</p>

<p>"It's charming," declared Miss Marlowe
who had come in just before. "Congratulations,
Patricia, you've certainly done your
share towards making to-night a success. And
you're ready in such good time&mdash;it's nice not
to have a rush at the end."</p>

<p>"That's really owing to Judy, Miss Marlowe,"
said Patricia quickly; "she and the
others, too, have been splendid."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you've had such good helpers,"
said Miss Marlowe, giving Judith a special
smile of approval. "I shan't give a thought
to the stage management, Patricia; I'll leave
that and the properties to you&mdash;there are one
or two who still need help with their parts and
I want to give them every moment possible."</p>

<p>Judith fairly glowed with happiness as she
watched Miss Marlowe disappearing down the
hall. Miss Marlowe's words of praise were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
eagerly prized&mdash;they really meant something.
Like most other people Judith loved to be
approved of, and she had lived these last few
days in an atmosphere of admiration. She
was this afternoon to receive a special prize
in English, and the second prize for General
Proficiency in her Form. She had won the
tennis trophy for her House, and in many little
ways latterly the Senior girls and her own
friends had shown her that they turned to her as
to a leader; she knew that it was whispered
about that next year she and Nancy would
probably be prefects. It would be hard, of
course, but it would be awfully nice&mdash;</p>

<p>Patricia broke in upon her happy musings
by calling to Josephine who was leaving the
Hall.</p>

<p>"Is everything O.K. in the make-up room,
Jo?"</p>

<p>"Molly Seaton's wig hasn't come yet, but
Stewarts say they'll have it here by three
o'clock," answered Josephine.</p>

<p>"And they promised faithfully to have it
here last night," said Patricia disgustedly.
"Now will you be certain sure to get it from
the parcel room and see that Molly has it in
plenty of time. I'll make the two of you responsible&mdash;Judy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
you remind her&mdash;we go
straight to the drawing-room for the reception
after prize-giving and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't worry your fussy old self," said Josephine
cheerfully; "nobody really believes in
me, but Judy never forgets. We'll put the
wig with our own fair hands on Molly Seaton's
head. Come on, Judy, and see if Cathy's
flowers have come yet."</p>

<p>Upstairs everything was in delightful confusion:
trunks were being carried off, last packings
attended to, every one was visiting every
one else, and every one was doing her best
to make her voice heard above the general
confusion.</p>

<p>After luncheon white frocks were donned
for prize-giving, and then the younger girls
went about in groups visiting the graduating
Sixth Form and admiring their flowers.</p>

<p>The crew of the "Jolly Susan" had clubbed
together to buy roses for their Captain.</p>

<p>"We can't get blue roses," Nancy had said
regretfully, "but let's get the palest pink we
can find and tie them with blue gauze. I'm
afraid that's all we can do to suggest sailor
boys. Whatever shall we do without her next
year?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>There were beautiful flowers everywhere
they went, but the crew were quite convinced
when they came back to the "Jolly Susan"
that none were lovelier than theirs, and most
certainly no one to compare with Catherine
herself.</p>

<p>Prize-giving proved even more exciting than
Judith had anticipated. "If only Daddy and
Mother could have been here," she thought, as
she took her place in the long line of white-frocked
girls and looked a bit wistfully at the
big audience which held the girls' fathers and
mothers. But that must be Uncle Tom&mdash;yes,
it was, and Aunt Nell&mdash;bless them. She
wouldn't feel lonely now. And yes&mdash;there
were Tom and Jack. Then Judith remembered
that she mustn't look about the audience,
but keep her mind on the programme. She
looked down at the printed sheet in her hand,
but she knew quite well where they were sitting,
and Jack's friendly smile was the first
she saw when she came down from the platform
with her prizes in her hand.</p>

<p>Prize-giving was an especially important
event for the Sixth, who were graduating.
To them it was perhaps the greatest moment
of the year, for the receiving of diploma or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
certificate, seeming to mark a parting of the
ways, was bitter sweet&mdash;bright with hopes of
the joys to come, but tinged with regret for
"the great glad days" that were now left
behind.</p>

<p>The School gave them a great ovation.
Judith, looking at the group of prefects and
captains who received a special pin as a badge
of honour, echoed Nancy's cry&mdash;how <span class="smcap">could</span>
they get along without them next year?</p>

<p>Miss Meredith held a reception afterwards
on the lawn, for it was a perfect June day.
Judith carried her prizes proudly for Aunt
Nell and Uncle Tom to inspect.</p>

<p>"I didn't trip after all, Aunt Nell," she
said laughingly; "if you only knew how relieved
I was to think that I had made my curtsey and
was down from the platform without mishap!"</p>

<p>Jack and Tom with Sally May and Nancy
joined the group and congratulations were the
order of the day. Sally May had a prize for
sketching to exhibit, and Nancy one for fine
sewing.</p>

<p>It was a gay, delightful party, and when
messengers began to send round word that
actors and committee members must go in for
early tea in order to be ready in good time for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
the play, Judith could hardly believe that
prize-giving was really over.</p>

<p>Judith and Nancy had still so much to discuss
concerning the day's happenings that they
refused to be separated, and Judith, who was
to help change the scenery, established Nancy
in a corner beside her so that she could share
in the fun behind the scenes.</p>

<p>Nancy was loud in her praises of the quaintness
of the stage-setting, and Judith, feeling
delightfully superior and important, enjoyed
herself enormously showing Nancy how they
had contrived this and that to better the effect.</p>

<p>Peeping around one corner of the curtain
they could see the audience arriving, and behind
in the make-up room there was a buzz of
voices and a general feeling of excitement
which was quite thrilling.</p>

<p>Presently the hall was full, the orchestra
had finished their overture, and had begun all
over again, but the actors did not appear.
Something must have gone wrong.</p>

<p>"Miss Marlowe <i>will</i> be annoyed," whispered
Judith to Nancy. "She simply hates being
late." And curiosity tempted her to slip into
the dressing-room to see what was happening.</p>

<p>The room was humming with repressed excitement;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
last touches of rouge were being
added; Lady Catherine de Burgh was walking
solemnly up and down before a mirror practising
the art of making her plumes "nod majestically,"
Sally May was saying feverishly
over and over again, "My dear Mr. Bennet,
have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at
last?"&mdash;"If I can just keep talking I won't be
nervous," she confided to Jane&mdash;"My dear
Mr. Bennet, have you heard that Netherfield
Park&mdash;"; Althea (Bingley) was practising
bows with Josephine in a secluded corner of
the adjoining room, and Catherine was having
the finishing touches put to her pretty curls.
Everything seemed as it should be&mdash;no, Mr.
Bennet (Molly Seaton) was protesting almost
tearfully to Miss Marlowe, "It was never
given to me: Patricia said it was late and she'd
look after it." Judith's face flamed&mdash;Molly's
wig! She had entirely forgotten it!</p>

<p>"Where is Patricia?" said Miss Marlowe in
a voice whose quality made the room suddenly
become perfectly quiet. Judith tried to speak,
but her lips and throat had suddenly become
quite dry. How could she tell Miss Marlowe
it was her fault!</p>

<p>Sally May was speaking&mdash;something about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
a telegram and Patricia&mdash;Judith didn't hear
her&mdash;a furious argument was raging within
her&mdash;with lightning-like speed Top Self and
Deep-Down Self strove for mastery. "How
can you tell Miss Marlowe it's your fault&mdash;after
the way you've been trusted and looked
up to?&mdash;It was Josephine's job, anyway&mdash;you
did yours"&mdash;"But of course you can't
let Patricia be blamed"&mdash;"Miss Marlowe will
never forgive you"&mdash;"You can't let Patricia
be blamed for it&mdash;you <span class="smcap">were</span> to remind&mdash;"</p>

<p>The silence had penetrated to the far corner
and as Judith opened her lips to speak, Josephine's
horrified tones were heard.</p>

<p>"It's my fault, Miss Marlowe, Patricia
asked me to look after it."</p>

<p>"You, Josephine?" Miss Marlowe's tones
were icy. "Well, you have been consistently
careless all year: I wonder that you were
given any responsibility."</p>

<p>Judith could not bear that.</p>

<p>"Miss Marlowe," she began in a voice which
sounded curiously thin and weak.</p>

<p>But the words were drowned in Sally May's
shout:</p>

<p>"Why, here's the box&mdash;it's been under this
cloak all the time."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>The others bent forward to see the precious
wig, and Top Self was quick to make one more
effort.</p>

<p>"What a little thing to make such a tremendous
fuss about! No one has seen you&mdash;just
slip off again to your post, and when Josephine
tells you about it you can take your
share of the blame then&mdash;Miss Marlowe
doesn't want to be bothered with any one
else confessing to something that's all over
with now&mdash;why, it will even look like pretending
to be too honest if you interrupt her
now&mdash;"</p>

<p>Top Self probably had any number of arguments
besides; these flashed through her
mind in a second, but Deep-Down Self answered
them in a most wonderful way and
just as quickly. Thinking about it afterwards,
Judith couldn't understand how the most important
thing that had happened to her during
the whole year could have occurred in a second
or two, and she found it very difficult to put
into words, even for herself, just how Deep-Down
Self had conquered. It seemed as if
suddenly those who stood for the best and
finest things in York Hill rose in her mind and
confronted Top Self&mdash;Catherine, Nancy, Josephine,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
Eleanor, Miss Marlowe, Miss Ashwell,
Miss Meredith&mdash;and when Judith had seen
them she turned again to Top Self&mdash;but Top
Self had gone!</p>

<p>It had only taken a second of time, but even
in that second fresh tragedy had been added.
The wig was a beautiful golden blonde!</p>

<p>"Quick, give me the powder," Miss Marlowe
was saying. "Somebody get the charcoal;
we'll have to streak it a bit to make it grey."</p>

<p>Judith managed to get charcoal before any
one else, and then said desperately,</p>

<p>"It's my fault as much as Josephine's, Miss
Marlowe&mdash;more mine, for Patricia told me
to be sure to remind Josephine."</p>

<p>"You, Judith?" said Miss Marlowe coldly.
"I <span class="smcap">am</span> surprised,"&mdash;and she wasted no more
time on Judith, who went away feeling that
she could never be happy again.</p>

<p>Judith didn't go back to Nancy, she wanted
to be alone. Her humiliation was very real&mdash;not
because she had forgotten, though it <span class="smcap">had</span>
hurt her pride to think that she had been careless.
But there was a deeper hurt than that&mdash;she
had actually hesitated to take her share
of the blame, in spite of precept and example in
her home, and here this year at York<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
Hill. She had almost done something quite
dishonourable.</p>

<p>"They'd despise me if they knew," thought
Judith, crouching down behind some scenery
and wishing that she could run away instead
of waiting to help. "Why, oh, why do I make
so many mistakes and fail so often? But I
won't&mdash;I won't let that horrid little Top Self
conquer"&mdash;and, interested in the working of
her own mind, she paused a moment to consider
how curious it was that all those faces should
rise to aid her just when she needed them&mdash;"Seemed
almost as if they <span class="smcap">were</span> Deep-Down
Self&mdash;but of course they couldn't be, because
that's me&mdash;but it's queer&mdash;they seemed like
a part of me too&mdash;"</p>

<p>Just then Catherine on her way to the stage
caught sight of Judith, a crumpled little heap
behind the screen. She hadn't a moment, but
she took one, nevertheless, to stop and pat the
back of Judith's neck&mdash;her face she couldn't
see&mdash;and say affectionately, "Never mind,
Judy, dear&mdash;we all forget sometimes&mdash;you're
O.K. really."</p>

<p>Just a moment&mdash;but it brought Judith up
out of her gloom.</p>

<p>"Dear old Cathy," she said to herself as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
she scrambled up to watch the heroine make
her entrance, "she's a brick, a real brick&mdash;I'll
<span class="smcap">never</span> do anything I'd be ashamed to tell
her about."</p>

<p>"Hullo!" whispered Nancy; "come on over
here and you can see better&mdash;what's the
matter?"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Well, you look&mdash;as if you'd had a small
fortune left you."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;think&mdash;I have," said Judith soberly
but happily.</p>

<p>"Sh&mdash;sh&mdash;sh," commanded Nancy, "they're
beginning. Here, you watch from this crack,
and I'll take this one." And they were soon
lost to all sense of surroundings as they followed
Jane Austen's delightful story.</p>

<p>Sally May was a delicious Mrs. Bennet&mdash;her
archness, her querulousness, and above all
her talkativeness. Was it Sally May or Mrs.
Bennet? Molly Seaton, as Mr. Bennet, proved
an excellent foil&mdash;reserved, quiet, full of a
delightful sarcastic humour.</p>

<p>Miss Marlowe sat in the shadow of the green
curtain holding the typewritten manuscript,
ready to prompt any one who stumbled&mdash;the
first scene was always the difficult one; but it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
went without a hitch and Judith was soon
busily helping to transform the parlour into
a ball-room, and listening with great excitement
to the applause on the other side of the
green curtains.</p>

<p>Then the stage was filled with dainty,
slim, ringletted ladies in high-waisted flowered
frocks and gentlemen in tight breeches, long-tailed
coats, and high stocks, and the curtains
rolled back to disclose a prettier and statelier
dance than a modern audience often sees.</p>

<p>As the story progressed, Catherine as Elizabeth,
and Eleanor as Mr. Collins, divided the
honours pretty equally. No one who had
not seen Catherine as Viola could have guessed
what a charming Elizabeth she would make,
and Eleanor&mdash;well, Eleanor <i>was</i> Mr. Collins,
a very triumph of imagination! Eleanor had
not Catherine's gift, and to picture Elizabeth's
delicate subtleties and humours would have
been quite beyond her, but she had walked,
and talked, and eaten with Mr. Collins until
she was that worthy gentleman's double.</p>

<p>Who could ever forget the courtship scene,
with Mr. Collins's ponderous declaration and
dexterous withdrawal from Mrs. Bennet's
clutches? Contrary to Judith's fears, Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
Collins's coat withstood the pressure of his
windy eloquence and all the seams held fast.</p>

<p>Scene followed scene. Jane's love-story
and Lydia's and Elizabeth's until the tangles,
always tied in true lovers' garlands, were disentangled
one by one and Mrs. Bennet was
able to sing her hymn of joy. "Three daughters
married! Ten thousand a year! What
will become of me? I shall go distracted."</p>

<p>It was a great success, of course, the Reunion
Play always was, and each one better
than the last as every one said, but Judith and
Nancy privately decided that nothing could
ever be better&mdash;it was perfect.</p>

<p>The play over, benches and chairs were piled
up at the sides, the orchestra played an entrancing
tune, and every one danced; Mr.
Collins with Lady Catherine de Burgh, and
Elizabeth with Judith, Mrs. Bennet with
Nancy, and Jane with Bingley.</p>

<p>Then by and by Miss Meredith gave a signal
to the orchestra, and big girls and little, Old
and New, formed a great triple hand-clasped
circle and sang together as was the custom,
"Should Auld Acquaintance be Forgot?"
And if some of the Old Girls found they
couldn't sing at all because their voices grew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
hoarse and husky, as they thought of what old
acquaintance in York Hill had meant to them
and was going to mean to their young sisters
and daughters, what wonder!</p>

<p>It was over. The guests were moving slowly
down to the drawing-rooms for refreshments,
and the School and the Old Girls crossed the
quadrangle and had their lemonade and cake
in Big Hall. In twos and threes the girls stood
making plans for next year, or talking over
the events of the day.</p>

<p>Some one at the piano began to play "Forty
Years On," the last song always at York Hill
on Prize Day.</p>

<p>Judith didn't want to sing&mdash;she slipped
out through the open door. It was a glorious
sight, the moon was nearly full, and the quadrangle
was flooded with silvery light.</p>

<p>In front of her was the great main School
building, its windows blazing with light, the
silhouette of the bell-tower etched against the
sky. She could hear the Old Girls behind her
singing in the Gymnasium&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Forty years on, when afar and asunder<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Parted are those who are singing to-day,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">When you look back and forgetfully wonder</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">What you were like in your work and your play."</span><br />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>Memories of the past year crowded into
Judith's mind. The first days, and this splendid
last week; she could not put into words
even to herself what it had all meant to her,
but deep within herself she realized that Aunt
Nell's wish had come true&mdash;York Hill was
helping her to be true to the best she knew.</p>

<p>The insistent rhythm of the chorus caught
her and held her:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Follow up! Follow up!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Till the field ring again and again</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With the tramp of twenty-two men&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Follow up! Follow up!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>Judith had sung "Forty Years On" many
times. It was a favourite for the Saturday-night
sing-songs, but never before had it
gripped her like this. Out into the night
floated the golden notes of Kathryn Fleming's
glorious voice&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Oh, the great days in the distance enchanted,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Days of fresh air in the rain and the sun</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">How we rejoiced as we struggled and panted,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Hardly believable forty years on.</span><br />
<br />
&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;<br />
<br />
"God give us bases to guard and beleaguer;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Games to play out whether earnest or fun;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Fights for the fearless and goals for the eager:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Twenty, and thirty, and forty years on."</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></div>

<p>"Follow up" sang the beautiful voice&mdash;and
then came the answering refrain from
hundreds of York Hill daughters&mdash;"Follow
up! Follow up!"</p>

<p>A great wave of emotion shook Judith&mdash;the
pent-up feeling of the last few days must
find expression; with an unconscious dramatic
gesture she turned to the School and held out
her hands. "Oh, I <span class="smcap">will</span> have big ideals and
not little ones&mdash;I wanted to say a big 'Thank
you' the other night, dear York Hill&mdash;and I
couldn't&mdash;I hadn't the words&mdash;and I can't
now&mdash;but I will, I <span class="smcap">will</span> follow up."</p>
